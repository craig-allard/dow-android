<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fact: Looking Back at Genre History by <a href="http://www.amyhsturgis.com/">Amy H Sturgis</a></strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Main Fiction: &#8220;Chasing Satellites&#8221; by <a href="http://anthonycardno.com/">Anthony Cardno</a></strong></p>
<p>Originally appeared in the anthology <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Beyond-Sun-Bryan-Thomas-Schmidt/dp/1933846380">Beyond the Sun, </a></em>edited by Bryan Thomas Schmidt.</p>
<p>Anthony R. Cardno&#8217;s first published work was a &#8220;hero history&#8221; of Marvel Comics&#8217; The Invaders for the late, lamented Amazing Heroes. His short stories have appeared or are forthcoming in <em>Shroud, Galactic Games, A Thousand Words For War, Willard &amp; Maple, Chelsea Station, Space Battles: Full Throttle Space Tales Volume 6,  Beyond The Sun, OOMPH: A Little Super Goes A Long Way, and Tales of the Shadowmen Volume 10</em>. In 2014 he edited <em>The Many Tortures of Anthony Cardno</em>, in which 22 authors Tuckerized him, to raise money for the American Cancer Society. He is also the author of a children’s book, The Firflake: A Christmas Story. In addition to a full time job as a corporate trainer, Anthony is a proofreader for <em>Lightspeed</em> magazine, writes book reviews, and occasionally blogs on www.anthonycardno.com, where you can also find some of his other short stories. In what little other spare time he has, Anthony has been known to film cover song videos for YouTube. You can find him on Twitter @talekyn.</p>
<p><strong>Narrated by Rikki LaCoste </strong></p>
<p>With relevance to genre fiction audio, he has been a regular reader for <a href="http://pseudopod.org/?s=Rikki">Pseudopod </a>over the years, and also narrates and voice acts for the <a href="http://www.thenosleeppodcast.com/?s=rikki">No Sleep Podcast,</a> <a href="http://talestoterrify.com/?s=rikki">Tales To Terrify</a>, and in early 2015, produced, narrated, and wrote music for an episode of <a href="http://www.castofwonders.org/2015/04/episode-164-amicae-aeternum-by-ellen-klages/">Cast of Wonders</a>, on which he is now on staff as an <a href="http://www.castofwonders.org/about-us/">audio producer</a>. His thirteen year old daughter Isis LaCoste also has credits in <a href="http://pseudopod.org/2014/12/24/pseudopod-christmas-2014-bonus-flash-tradition/">Pseudopod</a>,<a href="http://www.thenosleeppodcast.com/?s=isis"> No Sleep</a> and <a href="http://www.castofwonders.org/2015/04/episode-164-amicae-aeternum-by-ellen-klages/">Cast of Wonders</a>.</p>
<p>Listen to their work, from the links in the show notes, and feel free to contact Rikki for more narration and voice acting from either Rikki or Isis, or both, who are based out of Toronto Canada. Apart from the narration world, his other hats include being the creator and co-host of a quirky yet provocative podcast called Kakophonos Internet Radio – which is presently in cryogenic suspension – a link to memorable clips from the archives to which you can listen will be in the show notes.</p>
<p><a href="http://panthea.bandcamp.com">Panthea</a> is his collection of original musical compositions. He is also an environmental activist, having worked for Greenpeace Canada, the Communications Steward for <a href="http://alfheimvalley.com/%5d">Alfheim Valley Eco Resort</a>. One of the goals of Rikki&#8217;s life is to figure out what kind of English accent Tony C Smith speaks with, which he tentatively guesses to be some exotic genre of Scottish, a type of Welsh, or an insane breed of Jamacan.</p>

<p>Tricia Glock is the pen name of a person who works too many jobs and has far too little time to write as much as she should.  She likes her cat more than her computer, which is unfortunate, and her family more than her cat, which is less so.

Trained as an actress and singer, she has worked in entertainment for over 20 years and currently splits her time between writing speculative fiction, helping her husband run their voice-over company, <a href="http://www.offstimme.com/">Offstimme</a>, and voicing everything from commercials and documentaries to public transport announcements.</p>

cosmology, black holes, merging galaxies, quasars, and asteroids.</p>
<p>He is also the editor of Jonathan&#8217;s Space Report, a free internet<br />
newsletter founded in 1989 which provides  technical details of<br />
satellite launches, and he was formerly a columnist in Sky and Telescope<br />

Clarke and Stanley Kubrick in their development of 2001: A Space Odyssey as well as Kubrick’s adaptation of A Clockwork Orange.

                Mikael is also an active writer, musician and recording artist, having scored the soundtrack to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2554822/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast&quot;&gt;an independent short film&lt;/a&gt;, produced and engineered &lt;a href=&quot;http://fourfingerfive.com/?post_type=music&amp;p=46&quot;&gt;critically acclaimed rock records&lt;/a&gt;, and written, performed and recorded s&lt;a href=&quot;https://soundcloud.com/mikaelnaramore/tracks&quot;&gt;everal “silly little lo-fi rock songs” of his own&lt;/a&gt;.

<p><strong>Interview: <a href="https://www.insidescience.org/">Ben Stein</a></strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Main Fiction: &#8220;The End of the War&#8221; by <a href="http://djangowexler.com/">Django Wexler</a></strong></p>
<p>Originally published in Asimov&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Django Wexler is the author of the epic fantasy series <em>The Shadow Campaigns </em>from Ace and Roc books<strong>.</strong> He graduated from Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh with degrees in creative writing and computer science, and worked for the university in artificial intelligence research.  Eventually he migrated to Microsoft in Seattle, where he now lives with two cats and a teetering mountain of books.  When not writing, he wrangles computers, paints tiny soldiers, and plays games of all sorts.</p>
<p><strong>Narrated by: Mark Kilfoil</strong></p>
<p>Mark “the Encaffeinated ONE” Kilfoil loves fiction, so much so that he’s written some (such as the Parsec-nominated Tainted Roses), read quite a lot (a library of over a thousand half-read books and growing) and now narrates them (sometimes actually recorded for others). He’s found that volunteering for a dozen years in radio was a decent way to get a full-time job as a Program Director at a community radio station in Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada, but not such a great way to finish his thesis, so he stopped at a Masters in Computer Science. He can be heard frequently on CHSRfm.ca, and two of his shows irregularly appear as podcasts, and can be found at <a href="http://encaffeinated.ca">encaffeinated.ca</a> (CAFFEEN!) and <a href="http://theweirdshow.com">theweirdshow.com</a> (The WEIRD Show, winner of a Parsec Award for “Best Infotainment”). He likes cats enough to pet them but not enough to own one, and computers enough to own several but pet none of them. He will someday write a million words, but at this rate, that will require life extension, so he eagerly awaits the ability to upload into a computer, if that hasn’t already happened and this is all only a simulation.</p>

                Main Fiction: &quot;Behind the First Years&quot; by &lt;a href=&quot;http://infomancy.net/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Stewart C. Baker&lt;/a&gt;

                Originally published in Cosmos magazine

                Stewart C Baker is an academic librarian, haikuist, and speculative fiction writer. His fiction and poetry has appeared in Daily Science Fiction, Nature, and Flash Fiction Online, among other magazines. Stewart was born in England, has spent time in South Carolina, Japan, and California, and now lives in western Oregon with his wife and children—although if anyone asks, he’ll say he’s from the Internet. His website is &lt;a href=&quot;http://infomancy.net/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://infomancy.net/&lt;/a&gt;

                Narrated by &lt;a href=&quot;http://jonathandanz.com.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jonathan Danz&lt;/a&gt;

                Jonathan Danz exists in a parallel dimension that looks suspiciously like West Virginia. When he’s not trundling over rock and root on his velocipede, he labors to hammer stories out of unruly words. With the help of his wife and daughter, he manages to keep track of his car keys, his priorities, and his mind. Should you find yourself in the dusty corners of cyberspace, you may glimpse Words and Coffee, an occasional repository of his thought-mud found at &lt;a href=&quot;http://jonathandanz.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;jonathandanz.com&lt;/a&gt;.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Coming Up&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Main Fiction: &#8220;Thirteen Views of a Cardboard City&#8221; by <a href="http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/">William Gibson</a></strong></p>
<p>Originally published in <em>New Worlds </em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/" target="_blank">William Gibson</a> is the author of nine novels, most recently <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Peripheral-William-Gibson/dp/0399158448" target="_blank">The Peripheral</a></em>, and, with Bruce Sterling, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Difference-Engine-William-Gibson/dp/0440423627" target="_blank"><em>The Difference Engine</em></a>. He was born in South Carolina. He lives in Canada.</p>
<p><strong>Narrated by: Nicholas Camm</strong></p>
<p>Nick is an actor, audio-book narrator and voice-overer. He recently did a few scenes on the telly with Derek Jacobi, which made him tingle. He’s just finished shooting the feature film ‘Slapper and Me’, which mostly involved him sitting in a sleazy pub for 12 hours a day smoking herbal cigarettes, drinking tepid, non-alcoholic ale and pretending to be in the 1970’s. He thinks it should be out in the autumn, but they’re not telling him, probably because they don’t want him turning up at the première in his cheap suit.</p>
<p>Audio-bookwise, Nick is currently four books into narrating the mystery/thriller ‘Eddie Malloy Series’, written by Richard Pitman and Joe McNally. Set in the skullduggerous world of horse-racing, reluctant part-time detective Eddie gets involved in various capers and generally solves stuff. It’s the first time in many a year that Nick has read, and enjoyed, a set of novels where spaceships refuse to appear. Notwithstanding, Nick has made a polite suggestion to the authors that shiny, future-type stuff might feature in the next of the series (a Hawking-drive, killer robot horse, perhaps). This has fallen on deaf ears.</p>
<p>If you want him to narrate a book for you, he can be found on Twitter, here: @NickCamm1</p>
<p>Or, if you want him to do some acting for you, here: http://amberltd.co.uk/?client=nicholas-camm</p>

<p><strong>Fact: Science News by <a href="http://www.uvulaaudio.com/books.html">J J Campanella</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Main Fiction: &#8220;Mountain Screamers&#8221; by <a href="http://dougcsouza.com./" target="_blank">Doug Souza</a></strong></p>
<p>Originally published in Asimov&#8217;s.</p>
<p>I wrote “Mountain Screamers” because I wanted to see how cougars would fare in the future. I imagined they’d be marveled by society while battling extinction. I was pleasantly surprised when the characters took over the story. My grandparents—one set a pair of teachers, the other dairy owners—edged their way in, and I am grateful for this. Asimov’s was my first pro-sale.The day I got the news, I called my wife immediately—she screamed and I did made-up karate moves; we were both at work. I have several stories sold in semi-professional markets and have placed as a finalist in the Writers of the Future Contest. I can be found at: dougcsouza.com.</p>
<p><strong>Narrated by Jonathan Sharp</strong></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">I was born in southern New Mexico in the nexus between Area 51, Trinity Site, and Spaceport America. I attended culinary school in Portland Oregon and have managed a number of restaurants, cafés, and bakeries.  By day I am the produce manager of a natural grocery store. By night I practice narration and voice acting while dreaming of a future filled with world travel via sailboat, along side my lovely wife Paige.</span></p>
<p><strong>Short Fiction: &#8220;Close Encounter of the Worst Kind&#8221; by Y. N. Thon</strong></p>
<p>Originally published in Every Day Fiction</p>
<p>Y.N. Thom is a writer and an internet security consultant. She has a bachelor&#8217;s degree in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology from Princeton University, a law degree from Vermont Law School and is an alumna of Cat Rambo&#8217;s online writing workshops. She&#8217;s hiked parts of the Great Continental Divide and enjoyed tuk-tuks rides in Bangkok. A Puerto Rican expat living in Canada, she survives the winters snuggling with her husband and two cats. When she&#8217;s not watching K-dramas you can find her socializing on Google+.</p>
<p><strong>Narrated by Al Barclay</strong></p>
<p>Al Barclay has worked extensively over 15 years, most notably playing opposite James McAvoy and Michael Sheen in Stephen Fry&#8217;s Bright Young Things, and with David Thewlis in Luc Besson&#8217;s The Lady. He will be in the West End at The Arts Theatre this December playing Scrooge in A Christmas Carol.</p>
<p>He also once drank two bottles of gin with Peter O&#8217;Toole, and danced the night away in Camden with Amy Winehouse.</p>

                I wrote “Mountain Screamers” because I wanted to see how cougars would fare in the future. I imagined they’d be marveled by society while battling extinction. I was pleasantly surprised when the characters took over the story. My grandparents—one set a pair of teachers, the other dairy owners—edged their way in, and I am grateful for this. Asimov’s was my first pro-sale.The day I got the news, I called my wife immediately—she screamed and I did made-up karate moves; we were both at work. I have several stories sold in semi-professional markets and have placed as a finalist in the Writers of the Future Contest. I can be found at: dougcsouza.com.

                Narrated by Jonathan Sharp

                I was born in southern New Mexico in the nexus between Area 51, Trinity Site, and Spaceport America. I attended culinary school in Portland Oregon and have managed a number of restaurants, cafés, and bakeries.  By day I am the produce manager of a natural grocery store. By night I practice narration and voice acting while dreaming of a future filled with world travel via sailboat, along side my lovely wife Paige.

                Short Fiction: &quot;Close Encounter of the Worst Kind&quot; by Y. N. Thon

                Originally published in Every Day Fiction

                Y.N. Thom is a writer and an internet security consultant. She has a bachelor&#039;s degree in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology from Princeton University, a law degree from Vermont Law School and is an alumna of Cat Rambo&#039;s online writing workshops. She&#039;s hiked parts of the Great Continental Divide and enjoyed tuk-tuks rides in Bangkok. A Puerto Rican expat living in Canada, she survives the winters snuggling with her husband and two cats. When she&#039;s not watching K-dramas you can find her socializing on Google+.

                Narrated by Al Barclay

                Al Barclay has worked extensively over 15 years, most notably playing opposite James McAvoy and Michael Sheen in Stephen Fry&#039;s Bright Young Things, and with David Thewlis in Luc Besson&#039;s The Lady. He will be in the West End at The Arts Theatre this December playing Scrooge in A Christmas Carol.

                He also once drank two bottles of gin with Peter O&#039;Toole, and danced the night away in Camden with Amy Winehouse.

<p>Fact: Looking Back at Genre History by Amy H Sturgis</p>
<p><a href="http://eldritchhobbit.livejournal.com/533757.html">StarWars &#8211; Amy H. Sturgis</a></p>
<p>Main Fiction: &#8220;Usher&#8221; by <a href="http://jaywerkheiser.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Jay Werkheiser</a></p>
<p>Originally published in Analog Science-Fiction and Fact.</p>
<p>Bio: Jay teaches chemistry and physics to high school students, where  he often finds inspiration for stories in classroom  discussions.   Not surprisingly, his stories often deal with alien biochemistries, weird physics, and their effects on the people  who interact with them.  Many of his stories have appeared in Analog, with others scattered among several other science-fiction magazines and anthologies.  You can follow  him on  twitter @JayWerkheiser or read his (much neglected) blog  at  http://jaywerkheiser.blogspot.com/</p>
<p>Narrated by Mark Kilfoil</p>
<p>Mark “the Encaffeinated ONE” Kilfoil loves fiction, so much so that he’s written some (such as the Parsec-nominated Tainted Roses), read quite a lot (a library of over a thousand half-read books and growing) and now narrates them (sometimes actually recorded for others). He’s found that volunteering for a dozen years in radio was a decent way to get a full-time job as a Program Director at a community radio station in Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada, but not such a great way to finish his thesis, so he stopped at a Masters in Computer Science. He can be heard frequently on CHSRfm.ca, and two of his shows irregularly appear as podcasts, and can be found at <a href="http://encaffeinated.ca">encaffeinated.ca</a> (CAFFEEN!) and <a href="http://theweirdshow.com">theweirdshow.com</a> (The WEIRD Show, winner of a Parsec Award for “Best Infotainment”). He likes cats enough to pet them but not enough to own one, and computers enough to own several but pet none of them. He will someday write a million words, but at this rate, that will require life extension, so he eagerly awaits the ability to upload into a computer, if that hasn’t already happened and this is all only a simulation.</p>

<p>Peter F. Hamilton was born in Rutland in 1960 and still lives in that county. He began writing in 1987, and sold his first short story to Fear magazine in 1988.

<p>Among the few ambitions Rikki wants to accomplish in his life, perhaps chief of them is to have Tony C. Smith collapse into his signature speech-arresting chuckles during the reading of his perhaps long-winded bio. Once he has achieved this goal, his life would be complete.</p>

<p>Main Fiction: &#8220;12 and Tag&#8221; by <a href="http://www.gregorynormanbossert.com/" target="_blank">Gregory Bossert</a></p>
<p>Originally published in Asimov&#8217;s.</p>
<p>I began writing fiction in 2009, at the age of 47, after artists Iain McCaig and Dermot Power dared me to write a screenplay. I wrote two, and then tried my hand at short stories, the second of which sold to Asimov’s Science Fiction. After that, I was hooked.</p>
<p>My story &#8220;The Telling”, originally published by Beneath Ceaseless Skies, won the 2013 World Fantasy Award for Short Fiction.  And my story &#8220;Bloom&#8221; from the December 2013 issue of Asimov’s was a finalist for the Theodore Sturgeon Memorial Award.</p>
<p>My day job is in filmmaking; currently I wrangle spaceships and superheroes at the legendary Industrial Light &amp; Magic in San Francisco. My film projects include Beowulf, Tim Burton’s Alice in Wonderland, Lucy, and the upcoming Tomorrowland and Avengers: Age of Ultron.</p>
<p>More information on my independent film projects, music and experimental musical instruments, and my writing can be found at www.suddensound.com.</p>
<p>“Twelve and Tag”, my sixth story for Asimov’s Science Fiction magazine, was originally drafted at the 2010 Clarion Writer&#8217;s Workshop. The game of Twelve and Tag has some loose roots in writing exercises from Ann and Jeff VanderMeer and George R. R. Martin. Much more of the inspiration came from the mutual trust under pressure evident in my fellow students and instructors there, not to mention a few raucous late nights of tall tales and emptied bottles. It is, more than anything else, about how we are continually and communally fabricating culture and identity.</p>
<p>Narrator: Jonathan Sharp</p>

<p>Main Fiction: &#8220;Bethlemen&#8221; by <a href="http://www.rifters.com/">Peter Watts</a></p>
<div><a class="" href="http://www.rifters.com/" target="_blank"><b>Peter Watts</b></a> is a (former) scientist, author, and convicted felon who spent the first two decades of his adult life as a marine biologist. After fleeing academia for science fiction he became known for  the habit of appending extensive technical bibliographies onto his novels; this both confers a veneer of credibility and covers his ass against nitpickers.  Described by the <i>Globe &amp; Mail</i> as &#8220;one of the very best [hard-sf writers] alive&#8221;, the overall effect of his prose is perhaps best summed up by critic James Nicoll: &#8220;Whenever I find my will to live becoming too powerful, I read Peter Watts&#8221;.</div>
<div></div>
<div>His debut novel (<i>Starfish</i>) was a NY Times Notable Book, while his most-recent-but-one (<i>Blindsight</i>)— a rumination on the utility of consciousness which, despite an unhealthy focus on space vampires, has become a required text in undergraduate courses ranging from philosophy to neuroscience— made the final ballot for numerous North American genre awards, winning exactly none of them. (It does, however, continue to win awards overseas, seven years later.) His shorter work has also picked up trophies in a variety of jurisdictions, notably a Hugo (possibly due to fan outrage over an altercation with US border guards in 2009) and a Shirley Jackson (possibly due to fan sympathy over nearly dying of flesh-eating disease in 2011).</div>
<div></div>
<div><i>Echopraxia</i>, a sort-of sequel to <i>Blindsight</i>, is only just out. History has not yet made its judgment.</div>
<div></div>

<p>Main Fiction: &#8220;Ticking&#8221; by <a href="http://www.allensteele.com/" target="_blank">Allen M. Steele</a></p>
<p>Before becoming a science fiction author, Allen Steele was a journalist who’d worked for newspapers and magazines in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Missouri, and his home state of Tennessee. But SF was his first love, so he eventually ditched journalism and instead began producing that which made him decide to be a writer in the first place.</p>
<p>Since then, Steele has published eighteen novels and nearly a hundred short stories. His work has received numerous awards, including three Hugos, and has been translated worldwide, mainly in languages he can’t read. He serves on the Board of Advisors for the Space Frontier Foundation and the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America. He also belongs to Sigma, a group of SF writers who frequently serve as unpaid consultants on matters regarding technology and security.</p>
<p>Allen Steele is a lifelong space buff, and this interest has not only influenced his writing, but also taken him to some interesting places. He has witnessed numerous space shuttle launches from Kennedy Space Center and has flown NASA’s shuttle cockpit simulator at the Johnson Space Center. In 2001, he testified before the U.S. House of Representatives in hearings regarding the future of space exploration. He would like very much to go into orbit, and hopes that one day he’ll to be able to afford to do so</p>
<p>Steele lives in western Massachusetts with his wife Linda and a continual procession of adopted dogs. He collects vintage science fiction books and magazines, spacecraft model kits, and dreams.</p>

<p>Main Fiction: &#8220;Men of Greywater Station&#8221; by <a href="http://www.georgerrmartin.com/" target="_blank">George R. R. Martin</a> and <a href="http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/ea.cgi?Howard_Waldrop" target="_blank">Howard Waldrop</a></p>
<p>Originally published Amazing Stories 1976 and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songs_of_Stars_and_Shadows" target="_blank"><em>Songs of Stars and Shadows</em></a></p>
<p>Hugo, Nebula, and World Fantasy Award–winner George R. R. Martin, New York Times bestselling author of the landmark A Song of Ice and Fire fantasy series, has been called “the American Tolkien.”</p>
<p>Born in Bayonne, New Jersey, George R. R. Martin made his first sale in 1971, and soon established himself as one of the most popular SF writers of the seventies. He quickly became a mainstay of the Ben Bova Analog with stories such as “With Morning Comes Mistfall,” “And Seven Times Never Kill Man,” “The Second Kind of Loneliness,” “The Storms of Windhaven” (in collaboration with Lisa Tuttle, and later expanded by them into the novel Windhaven), “Override,” and others, although he also sold to Amazing, Fantastic, Galaxy, Orbit, and other markets. One of his Analog stories, the striking novella “A Song for Lya,” won him his first Hugo Award, in 1974.</p>
<p>By the end of the seventies he had reached the height of his influence as a science fiction writer, and was producing his best work in that category with stories such as the famous “Sandkings,” his best-known story, which won both the Nebula and the Hugo in 1980 (he’d later win another Nebula in 1985 for his story “Portraits of His Children”); “The Way of Cross and Dragon,” which won a Hugo Award in the same year (making Martin the first author ever to receive two Hugo Awards for fiction in the same year): “Bitterblooms”; “The Stone City”; “Starlady”; and others. These stories would be collected in Sandkings, one of the strongest collections of the period. By now he had mostly moved away from Analog, although he would have a long sequence of stories about the droll interstellar adventures of Haviland Tuf (later collected in Tuf Voyaging) running throughout the eighties in the Stanley Schmidt Analog, as well as a few strong individual pieces such as the novella “Nightflyers.” Most of his major work of the late seventies and early eighties, though, would appear in Omni. The late seventies and eighties also saw the publication of his memorable novel Dying of the Light, his only solo SF novel, while his stories were collected in A Song for Lya, Sandkings, Songs of Stars and Shadows, Songs the Dead Men Sing, Nightflyers, and Portraits of His Children. By the beginning of the eighties he’d moved away from SF and into the horror genre, publishing the big horror novel Fevre Dream, and winning the Bram Stoker Award for his horror story “The Pear-Shaped Man” and the World Fantasy Award for his werewolf novella “The Skin Trade.” By the end of that decade, though, the crash of the horror market and the commercial failure of his ambitious horror novel The Armageddon Rag had driven him out of the print world and to a successful career in television instead, where for more than a decade he worked as story editor or producer on such shows as the new Twilight Zone and Beauty and the Beast.</p>
<p>After years away, Martin made a triumphant return to the print world in 1996 with the publication of the immensely successful fantasy novel<em> A Game of Thrones</em>, the start of his<em> Song of Ice and Fire</em> sequence. A freestanding novella taken from that work, “Blood of the Dragon,” won Martin another Hugo Award in 1997. Further books in the <em>Song of Ice and Fire</em> series—<em>A Clash of Kings, A Storm of Swords, A Feast for Crows</em>, and <em>A Dance with Dragons</em>, have made it one of the most popular, acclaimed, and bestselling series in all of modern fantasy. Recently, the books were made into an HBO TV series, <em><a href="http://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones#/" target="_blank">Game of Thrones</a></em>, which has become one of the most popular and acclaimed shows on television, and made Martin a recognizable figure well outside of the usual genre boundaries, even inspiring a satirical version of him on Saturday Night Live. Martin’s most recent books are the latest book in the Ice and Fire series, <em>A Dance with Dragons</em>; a massive retrospective collection spanning the entire spectrum of his career, GRRM: A RRetrospective; a novella collection, <em>Starlady and Fast-Friend</em>; a novel written in collaboration with Gardner Dozois and Daniel Abraham, Hunter’s Run; and, as editor, several anthologies edited in collaboration with Gardner Dozois, including <em>Warriors, Songs of the Dying Earth, Songs of Love and Death</em>, and <em>Down These Strange Streets</em>, and several new volumes in his long-running <em>Wild Cards</em> anthology series, including <em>Suicide Kings</em> and <em>Fort Freak</em>. In 2012, Martin was given the Life Achievement Award by the World Fantasy Convention.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/ea.cgi?Howard_Waldrop" target="_blank">Howard Waldrop</a></p>
<p>Waldrop&#8217;s stories combine elements such as alternate history, American popular culture, the American South, old movies (and character actors), classical mythology, and rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll music. His style is sometimes obscure or elliptical: Night of the Cooters is a pastiche of H. G. Wells&#8217; The War of the Worlds told from the perspective of a small town Texas sheriff (a homage to Slim Pickens) who finds an off-course Martian cylinder crashing down near his town; &#8220;Heirs of the Perisphere&#8221; involves robotic Disney characters waking up in the far future; &#8220;Fin de Cyclé&#8221; describes the Dreyfus affair from the perspective of bicycle enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Waldrop&#8217;s work is frequently out-of-print, though still available for sale on-line; several of his books have been reprinted in omnibus editions.</p>
<p>Narrated by: Nick Camm</p>
<p>Nick is an actor, audio-book narrator and voice-overer. He recently did a few scenes on the telly with Derek Jacobi, which made him tingle. He’s just finished shooting the feature film ‘Slapper and Me’, which mostly involved him sitting in a sleazy pub for 12 hours a day smoking herbal cigarettes, drinking tepid, non-alcoholic ale and pretending to be in the 1970’s. He thinks it should be out in the autumn, but they’re not telling him, probably because they don’t want him turning up at the première in his cheap suit.</p>
<p>Audio-bookwise, Nick is currently four books into narrating the mystery/thriller ‘Eddie Malloy Series’, written by Richard Pitman and Joe McNally. Set in the skullduggerous world of horse-racing, reluctant part-time detective Eddie gets involved in various capers and generally solves stuff. It’s the first time in many a year that Nick has read, and enjoyed, a set of novels where spaceships refuse to appear. Notwithstanding, Nick has made a polite suggestion to the authors that shiny, future-type stuff might feature in the next of the series (a Hawking-drive, killer robot horse, perhaps). This has fallen on deaf ears.</p>
<p>If you want him to narrate a book for you, he can be found on Twitter, here: @NickCamm1</p>

<p>Fact: Science News by <a href="http://www.uvulaaudio.com/books.html">J J Campanella</a></p>
<p>Main Fiction: &#8220;Persephone Descending&#8221; by <a href="http://www.derekkunsken.com/" target="_blank">Derek Kunsken</a></p>
<p>Originally published in Analog Magazine</p>
<p>Derek Künsken is a writer of science fiction and fantasy living in Gatineau, Québec. His fiction has appeared in Analog, Beneath Ceaseless Skies, Black Gate, On Spec, the three Escape Artists podcasts, several anthologies, and multiple times in Asimov’s. In 2012, he was short-listed for the Aurora Award and in 2013 his novelette “Way of the Needle” won the Asimov’s Award. He has a masters degree in molecular biology and a bloodline that traces its way through seven generations of Québécois.</p>
<p>Narrated by Mark Kilfoil</p>
<p>Mark &#8220;the Encaffeinated ONE&#8221; Kilfoil loves fiction, so much so that he&#8217;s written some (such as the Parsec-nominated Tainted Roses), read quite a lot (a library of over a thousand half-read books and growing) and now narrates them (sometimes actually recorded for others). He&#8217;s found that volunteering for a dozen years in radio was a decent way to get a full-time job as a Program Director at a community radio station in Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada, but not such a great way to finish his thesis, so he stopped at a Masters in Computer Science. He can be heard frequently on CHSRfm.ca, and two of his shows irregularly appear as podcasts, and can be found at <a href="http://encaffeinated.ca">encaffeinated.ca</a> (CAFFEEN!) and <a href="http://theweirdshow.com">theweirdshow.com</a> (The WEIRD Show, winner of a Parsec Award for &#8220;Best Infotainment&#8221;). He likes cats enough to pet them but not enough to own one, and computers enough to own several but pet none of them. He will someday write a million words, but at this rate, that will require life extension, so he eagerly awaits the ability to upload into a computer, if that hasn&#8217;t already happened and this is all only a simulation.</p>

By night I practice narration and voice acting while dreaming of a future filled with world travel via sailboat, along side my lovely wife Paige.</itunes:summary>

<p><b>Literary Copernicus&#8217;: The Cosmic Fiction of H.P. Lovecraft by Amy H Sturgis</b></p>
<p>Main Fiction: A Forgone Conclusion, by Connor and Sylvia Spruck Wrigley</p>
<p>Sylvia Spruck Wrigley writes hardcore aviation articles and soft science fiction stories (but never both at the same time). Born in Mannheim, she spent her formative years in Los Angeles and now splits her time between South Wales and the Costa del Sol: two coastal regions with almost nothing in common. The first book in her aviation series, *Why Planes Crash*, is available at all good e-book stores. She was nominated for a 2013 Nebula Award for her short story, Alive, Alive Oh. Sylvia&#8217;s most recent short stories can be found in Daily Science Fiction, Lightspeed, and Nature&#8217;s Futures. You can find out more about her at <a href="http://www.intrigue.co.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.intrigue.co.uk/</a></p>
<p>Narrated by: Ian Sewell</p>
<p>A lifetime reading SF meant he grew up wanting to be a mad scientist but he ended up doing IT Support which some people say has driven him mad. Despite his reading and work he refuses to interact with technology, the internet and a 10 year old mobile are as far as he will take it. He also refuses to use e-books considering them to be a work of Beelzebub along with parsnips.  A 13th Generation Essex man he moved as soon as he could and ended up the other side of London in Berkshire.  He is glad to have finally found a use for his big mouth!</p>

<p>Interview with Editor/Publisher of<a href="http://grimdarkmagazine.com/" target="_blank"> Grimdark Magazine</a>: Adrian Collins, by <a href="http://jeremyszal.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Jeremy Szal</a></p>
<p>Main Fiction: &#8220;Neighbours&#8221; by <a href="http://www.robinhobb.com/" target="_blank">Megan Lindholm</a></p>
<p>Originally published in anthology <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dangerous-Women-George-R-Martin/dp/076533206X" target="_blank">Dangerous Women</a>, edited by George R. R. Martin and Gardner Dozois.</p>
<p>Megan Lindholm was born in Oakland California in 1952, and spent the first ten years of her life in California. She grew up in a house full of books, rich with lovely illustrated fairy tale volumes, the works of Kipling, Robert Louis Stevenson, Dumas, Shakespeare and other classics in poetry as well as prose. When she was a preteen, her family moved from the California suburbs to a house on the rural outskirts of Fairbanks, Alaska. It was a huge change in lifestyle, from potato chips and avocado dip to growing potatoes and helping butcher moose. She loved the more rustic lifestyle, the opportunity to have wolf-hybrid dogs and access to undeveloped forest for long runs with her dogs.</p>
<p>In 1970, she married and moved with her husband Fred to Kodiak, Alaska. They lived in a very small village called Chiniak near a missile tracking site. Although she had been a writer since her early teens, at this time she first began to attempt selling her stories. She worked as a village correspondent for the local newspaper, and marketed her stories, with limited success, to children’s magazines. Over the next twelve years, she and her growing family spent time in Alaska, Idaho, and Hawaii. She sold stories to magazines such as Humpty Dumpty, Jack and Jill, Highlights for Children, and designed stories to be used in the Science Research Associates (SRA) graduated reading program. She won a grant from the Alaska State Council for the Arts for the coming of age story, “The Poaching” but her interest was turning more and more to fantasy.</p>
<p>In 1982, she sold her first fantasy novel, Harpy’s Flight. Ki and Vandien’s adventures continued in three more volumes (Luck of the Wheels, The Windsingers, and The Limbreth Gate.) Her other works included The Reindeer People, Wolf’s Brother, Alien Earth, Wizard of the Pigeons and a collaboration with Steven Brust for The Gypsy.</p>
<p>In 1995, her career as a novelist ended as she began to write epic fantasy under the pseudonym Robin Hobb, which she continues to do to this day. Her best known work is The Farseer Trilogy, and her most recent work as Hobb is The Fool’s Assassin (2014). As Megan Lindholm, her shorter works such as “A Touch of Lavender” was a finalist for both the Hugo and the Nebula award. “Silver Lady and the Fortyish Man” was also a Nebula finalist. Over the years, she has continued to write short stories as Megan Lindholm. Other short works recently published include “Neighbors” in the anthology Dangerous Women, edited by George R R Martin and Gardner Dozois. This anthology recently won the World Fantasy Award for Best Anthology.</p>
<p>Narrated by Pete Nixon:</p>
<p>Pete is a security engineer for Intel Security, a husband, father, and does writing and editing and narrating on the side. He edited, produced, and narrated the short story anthology and podcast “Green Eggs and Horror” which is a horror anthology inspired by the works of Dr. Seuss. The audio version of Green Eggs and Horror is available for free on greeneggsandhorror.com</p>

                Main Fiction: &quot;Neighbours&quot; by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.robinhobb.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Megan Lindholm&lt;/a&gt;

                Originally published in anthology &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Dangerous-Women-George-R-Martin/dp/076533206X&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dangerous Women&lt;/a&gt;, edited by George R. R. Martin and Gardner Dozois.

                Megan Lindholm was born in Oakland California in 1952, and spent the first ten years of her life in California. She grew up in a house full of books, rich with lovely illustrated fairy tale volumes, the works of Kipling, Robert Louis Stevenson, Dumas, Shakespeare and other classics in poetry as well as prose. When she was a preteen, her family moved from the California suburbs to a house on the rural outskirts of Fairbanks, Alaska. It was a huge change in lifestyle, from potato chips and avocado dip to growing potatoes and helping butcher moose. She loved the more rustic lifestyle, the opportunity to have wolf-hybrid dogs and access to undeveloped forest for long runs with her dogs.

                In 1970, she married and moved with her husband Fred to Kodiak, Alaska. They lived in a very small village called Chiniak near a missile tracking site. Although she had been a writer since her early teens, at this time she first began to attempt selling her stories. She worked as a village correspondent for the local newspaper, and marketed her stories, with limited success, to children’s magazines. Over the next twelve years, she and her growing family spent time in Alaska, Idaho, and Hawaii. She sold stories to magazines such as Humpty Dumpty, Jack and Jill, Highlights for Children, and designed stories to be used in the Science Research Associates (SRA) graduated reading program. She won a grant from the Alaska State Council for the Arts for the coming of age story, “The Poaching” but her interest was turning more and more to fantasy.

                In 1982, she sold her first fantasy novel, Harpy’s Flight. Ki and Vandien’s adventures continued in three more volumes (Luck of the Wheels, The Windsingers, and The Limbreth Gate.) Her other works included The Reindeer People, Wolf’s Brother, Alien Earth, Wizard of the Pigeons and a collaboration with Steven Brust for The Gypsy.

                In 1995, her career as a novelist ended as she began to write epic fantasy under the pseudonym Robin Hobb, which she continues to do to this day. Her best known work is The Farseer Trilogy, and her most recent work as Hobb is The Fool’s Assassin (2014). As Megan Lindholm, her shorter works such as “A Touch of Lavender” was a finalist for both the Hugo and the Nebula award. “Silver Lady and the Fortyish Man” was also a Nebula finalist. Over the years, she has continued to write short stories as Megan Lindholm. Other short works recently published include “Neighbors” in the anthology Dangerous Women, edited by George R R Martin and Gardner Dozois. This anthology recently won the World Fantasy Award for Best Anthology.

                Narrated by Pete Nixon:

                Pete is a security engineer for Intel Security, a husband, father, and does writing and editing and narrating on the side. He edited, produced, and narrated the short story anthology and podcast “Green Eggs and Horror” which is a horror anthology inspired by the works of Dr. Seuss. The audio version of Green Eggs and Horror is available for free on greeneggsandhorror.com</itunes:summary>

<p>Main Fiction: &#8220;The Fitter&#8221; by Timons Esaias</p>
<p>Timons Esaias is a satirist, writer and poet living in Pittsburgh. His works, ranging from literary to genre, have been published in eighteen languages. He has over a hundred poems in print, in markets ranging from <em>Asimov’s Science Fiction </em>and 5AM to <em>Elysian Fields Quarterly: The Literary Journal of Baseball</em>. He has also been a finalist for the British Science Fiction Award, and won the Asimov&#8217;s Readers Award. His story &#8220;Norbert and the System&#8221; has appeared in a textbook, and in college curricula. Recent science fiction appearances include <em>Asimov&#8217;s</em>, <em>Analog</em> and <em>Future Games</em>.His <em>News Nots</em> satire column appeared in seven newspapers, and convinced many readers that the Vatican was relocating to St. Louis; that the Pittsburgh Sewer &amp; Water Authority had decided to add Prozac to the water supply (along with sodium pentothal at tax time); and that several cities had chosen to re-zone by residents&#8217; floor-covering preferences only, since that is what truly divides us. He is Adjunct Faculty at Seton Hill University, in the Writing Popular Fiction MFA Program.He tends to go on and on about stuff, so be careful when asking him questions.</p>
<p>Narrated by: Nick Camm</p>
<p>Nick is an actor, audio-book narrator and voice-overer. He recently did a few scenes on the telly with Derek Jacobi, which made him tingle. He&#8217;s just finished shooting the feature film &#8216;Slapper and Me&#8217;, which mostly involved him sitting in a sleazy pub for 12 hours a day smoking herbal cigarettes, drinking tepid, non-alcoholic ale and pretending to be in the 1970&#8217;s. He thinks it should be out in the autumn, but they&#8217;re not telling him, probably because they don&#8217;t want him turning up at the première in his cheap suit.</p>
<p>Audio-bookwise, Nick is currently four books into narrating the mystery/thriller &#8216;Eddie Malloy Series&#8217;, written by Richard Pitman and Joe McNally. Set in the skullduggerous world of horse-racing, reluctant part-time detective Eddie gets involved in various capers and generally solves stuff. It&#8217;s the first time in many a year that Nick has read, and enjoyed, a set of novels where spaceships refuse to appear. Notwithstanding, Nick has made a polite suggestion to the authors that shiny, future-type stuff might feature in the next of the series (a Hawking-drive, killer robot horse, perhaps). This has fallen on deaf ears.</p>

<p>Narrated by: Mark Kilfoil</p>
<p>Mark &#8220;the Encaffeinated ONE&#8221; Kilfoil loves fiction, so much so that he&#8217;s written some (such as the Parsec-nominated Tainted Roses), read quite a lot (a library of over a thousand half-read books and growing) and now narrates them (sometimes actually recorded for others). He&#8217;s found that volunteering for a dozen years in radio was a decent way to get a full-time job as a Program Director at a community radio station in Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada, but not such a great way to finish his thesis, so he stopped at a Masters in Computer Science. He can be heard frequently on CHSRfm.ca, and two of his shows irregularly appear as podcasts, and can be found at <a href="http://encaffeinated.ca">encaffeinated.ca</a> (CAFFEEN!) and <a href="http://theweirdshow.com">theweirdshow.com</a> (The WEIRD Show, winner of a Parsec Award for &#8220;Best Infotainment&#8221;). He likes cats enough to pet them but not enough to own one, and computers enough to own several but pet none of them. He will someday write a million words, but at this rate, that will require life extension, so he eagerly awaits the ability to upload into a computer, if that hasn&#8217;t already happened and this is all only a simulation.</p>

He&#039;s found that volunteering for a dozen years in radio was a decent way to get a full-time job as a Program Director at a community radio station in Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada, but not such a great way to finish his thesis, so he stopped at a Masters in Computer Science. He can be heard frequently on CHSRfm.ca, and two of his shows irregularly appear as podcasts, and can be found at &lt;a href=&quot;http://encaffeinated.ca&quot;&gt;encaffeinated.ca&lt;/a&gt; (CAFFEEN!</itunes:summary>

<div>James Aquilone is an editor and writer, for fun and for profit, from Staten Island, New York.</div>

<div>His love of science fiction and reading began with the comic books he persuaded his mother to buy during trips to the corner newsstand.</div>
<div></div>
<div>&#8220;No Place for a Hero&#8221; was inspired by his own (so far unsuccessful) attempts to be a superhero.</div>

<p>Jen Watson holds an MFA in Theatre Performance &amp; Pedagogy from Texas Tech University, and a BA in English from Howard Payne University. She has been an actor/performer since her first kindergarten production over 30 years ago. From her home near Houston, Texas, she is now living her dream as an audiobook narrator on ACX.com and can be found at https://www.acx.com/narrator?p=A4KINJYDOCK8N and www.jenwatson.net.

<p>Jen and her husband of almost 13 years, Duane (an avid StarShipSofa fan), enjoy all things sci-fi and British, especially Doctor Who. She is patiently waiting for The Tenth Doctor (David Tennant) to arrive in the TARDIS on her doorstep (the hubby can come too…maybe). Their four fuzzy babies, cats Kaida, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and Mak, uphold their reputation as the married crazy cat lady and cat man.</p>

<p>Short Fiction: &#8220;Alien Alley&#8221;, by Jim Hume</p>
<p>Originally published at:<a href="http://www.everydayfiction.com/alien-alley-by-jr-hume/" target="_blank"> Every Day Fiction</a></p>
<p>JR Hume was raised on a small ranch in Montana and has been a soldier, an air traffic controller, an auto mechanic, a fleet buyer, and is now retired. He writes science fiction, fantasy, detective stories, and a lot of stories of no particular persuasion. Married forever to a charming Southern girl, he lives with her and two Schnauzers in Colorado.</p>
<p>Narrated by: Mark Kilfoil</p>
<p>Mark &#8220;the Encaffeinated ONE&#8221; Kilfoil loves fiction, so much so that he&#8217;s written some (such as the Parsec-nominated Tainted Roses), read quite a lot (a library of over a thousand half-read books and growing) and now narrates them (sometimes actually recorded for others).

He likes cats enough to pet them but not enough to own one, and computers enough to own several but pet none of them. He will someday write a million words, but at this rate, that will require life extension, so he eagerly awaits the ability to upload into a computer, if that hasn&#8217;t already happened and this is all only a simulation.</p>

<p>Narrated by: Marc Levinthal</p>
<p>Marc Levinthal is a writer and musician who has lived and worked in the Los Angeles area for over thirty years. Born and raised in Buffalo, New York, he moved to L.A. in the early eighties to become a rock star. That didn&#8217;t quite happen as planned, but a lot of other cool stuff did. He has been involved with both &#8220;The Music Business&#8221; (having co-written the hit single &#8220;Three Little Pigs&#8221; while in the band Green Jello) and &#8220;The Motion Picture Industry&#8221; (having co-written the score for the cult movie classic &#8220;Valley Girl.&#8221;)</p>
<p>Marc&#8217;s short stories have appeared in <em>Aboriginal Science Fiction</em>, <em>The Magazine of Bizarro Fiction</em>, and several anthologies, including <em>Mondo Zombie</em> and <em>Amazing Stories of the Flying Spaghetti Monster.</em>A novel co-written with John Skipp, &#8220;The Emerald Burrito of Oz,&#8221; was published by Eraserhead Press in 2010.

<p>Mark Lawrence is married with four children, one of whom is severely disabled. His day job is as a research scientist focused on various rather intractable problems in the field of artificial intelligence. He has held secret level clearance with both US and UK governments. At one point he was qualified to say ‘this isn’t rocket science … oh wait, it actually is’.</p>
<p>Between work and caring for his disabled child, Mark spends his time writing, playing computer games, tending an allotment, brewing beer, and avoiding DIY.</p>
<p>He has four books in print. The Broken Empire trilogy is complete and begins with Prince of Thorns. The Red Queen’s War trilogy opens with Prince of Fools.</p>

<p><em>No, really, I wasn’t being a smart-ass… sorry. I just never realised it was going to be this realistic.</em></p>
<p>Ian Whates lives in a quiet Cambridgeshire village with his partner, Helen, Honey, a manic cocker spaniel, and Calvin, a tailless black cat. He currently has two published novel series: the <em>Noise</em> books (space opera with a twist) via Solaris, and the <em>City of 100 Rows</em> trilogy (urban fantasy with steampunk overtones and SF underpinning) via Angry Robot. Some 60 of his short stories have appeared in various venues, two of which were shortlisted for BSFA Awards, while his work has received honourable mentions in <em>Years Best </em>anthologies. Most recently his fiction featured in Galaxy’s Edge #10 (September 2014), alongside the likes of Larry Niven, Mercedes Lackey, Robert J. Sawyer and George RR Martin. His second collection, <em>Growing Pains</em> (PS Publishing), appeared in 2013. Ian has edited a couple of <em>The Mammoth Book of… </em>titles for Constable and Robinson and the on-going <em>Solaris Rising</em> series for Solaris, one of which found its way onto the 2014 Philip K. Dick Award shortlist. In his spare time, he runs multiple award-winning independent publisher NewCon Press, which he founded by accident in 2006.</p>
<p>Ian has served a term as Overseas Director of SFWA (Science Fiction Writers of America) and spent five years as chairman the BSFA (British Science Fiction Association), stepping down in 2013. He remains a director of the latter.</p>

<p>Narrator: Mark Kilfoil</p>
<p>Mark &#8220;the Encaffeinated ONE&#8221; Kilfoil loves fiction, so much so that he&#8217;s written some (such as the Parsec-nominated Tainted Roses), read quite a lot (a library of over a thousand half-read books and growing) and now narrates them (sometimes actually recorded for others). He&#8217;s found that volunteering for a dozen years in radio was a decent way to get a full-time job as a Program Director at a community radio station in Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada, but not such a great way to finish his thesis, so he stopped at a Masters in Computer Science.

He likes cats enough to pet them but not enough to own one, and computers enough to own several but pet none of them.

<p>Main Fiction: Subduction, by <a href="http://www.paulmberger.com/">Paul Berger</a></p>
<p>Paul M. Berger has been a Japanese bureaucrat, an M.I.T. program administrator, an Internet<br />
entrepreneur, a butterfly wrangler, a museum tour guide and (God help him) a Wall Street<br />
recruiter, all of which, in the aggregate, may have prepared him for nothing except the cretion<br />
of speculative fiction. His work has appeared in publications including The Magazine of Fantasy<br />
&#038; Science Fiction, Rich Horton’s Space Opera, Rich Horton’s The Year’s Best Science Fiction<br />
and Fantasy 2011, Strange Horizons, Interzone, Podcastle and Escape Pod. The story of his<br />
battle against giant Japanese spiders was the first true-life memoir published in Weird Tales.<br />
He is a graduate of the 2008 Clarion workshop, and is a founding member of the stunningly<br />
talented New York-based writers’ group Altered Fluid. His next published story will appear inthe March/April issue of The Magazine of Fantasy &#038; Science Fiction “Subduction” was inspired by material he covers as a tour guide in the American Museum of</p>
<p>Natural History. He discusses the story in an interview with editor C. C. Finlay here:<br />
https:// www.sfsite.com/fsf/blog/2014/07/16/interview-paul-m-berger-on-subduction/</p>
<p>Narrator: Mark Kilfoil</p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Mark &#8220;the Encaffeinated ONE&#8221; Kilfoil loves fiction, so much so that he&#8217;s written some (such as the Parsec-nominated Tainted Roses), read quite a lot (a library of over a thousand half-read books and growing) and now narrates them (sometimes actually recorded for others). He&#8217;s found that volunteering for a dozen years in radio was a decent way to get a full-time job as a Program Director at a community radio station in Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada, but not such a great way to finish his thesis, so he stopped at a Masters in Computer Science. He can be heard frequently on CHSRfm.ca, and two of his shows irregularly appear as podcasts, and can be found at <a href="http://encaffeinated.ca" target="_blank">encaffeinated.ca</a> (CAFFEEN!) and <a href="http://theweirdshow.com" target="_blank">theweirdshow.com</a> (The WEIRD Show, winner of a Parsec Award for &#8220;Best Infotainment&#8221;). He likes cats enough to pet them but not enough to own one, and computers enough to own several but pet none of them. He will someday write a million words, but at this rate, that will require life extension, so he eagerly awaits the ability to upload into a computer, if that hasn&#8217;t already happened and this is all only a simulation.</span></p>
<p>Short Fiction: Iron Privateers, by Alexander Burns</p>
<p>Alexander Burns lives in Denton, Texas, and writes because he doesn’t have a basement in which to build robots or time machines. His work has appeared at Every Day Fiction, The Future Fire, Big Pulp, and other fine online journals. He can be found online at afburns.com.</p>
<p>Narrator: Anne-Marie Czajkowski.</p>
<p>Anne-Marie Czajkowski is a postgraduate of the Royal College of Music. She was a regular soloist at the Royal College with fellow student Alfie Boe and has sung on Channel 4 and Royal Gala performances on ITV. Her recently performed concert repertoire includes &#8216;Mild und Leise&#8217; from Tristan and Isolde by Wagner on tour in Berlin with LUSO in association with Opera North. She also has a teaching practice and amongst her students are Laura Marling who won 2012 British Female Solo Artist at the Brit Awards, comedian Lenny Henry and UK Classic Chart No1 artist, Rebecca Newman.</p>

                talented New York-based writers’ group Altered Fluid. His next published story will appear inthe March/April issue of The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction “Subduction” was inspired by material he covers as a tour guide in the American Museum of

                Natural History. He discusses the story in an interview with editor C. C. Finlay here:

                Narrator: Mark Kilfoil

                Mark &quot;the Encaffeinated ONE&quot; Kilfoil loves fiction, so much so that he&#039;s written some (such as the Parsec-nominated Tainted Roses), read quite a lot (a library of over a thousand half-read books and growing) and now narrates them (sometimes actually recorded for others). He&#039;s found that volunteering for a dozen years in radio was a decent way to get a full-time job as a Program Director at a community radio station in Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada, but not such a great way to finish his thesis, so he stopped at a Masters in Computer Science. He can be heard frequently on CHSRfm.ca, and two of his shows irregularly appear as podcasts, and can be found at &lt;a href=&quot;http://encaffeinated.ca&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;encaffeinated.ca&lt;/a&gt; (CAFFEEN!) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://theweirdshow.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;theweirdshow.com&lt;/a&gt; (The WEIRD Show, winner of a Parsec Award for &quot;Best Infotainment&quot;). He likes cats enough to pet them but not enough to own one, and computers enough to own several but pet none of them. He will someday write a million words, but at this rate, that will require life extension, so he eagerly awaits the ability to upload into a computer, if that hasn&#039;t already happened and this is all only a simulation.

<p>Fact: News About Rosetta by <a href="http://www.mpia-hd.mpg.de/homes/inskip/publications.html">Katherine Inskip</a> 03:40</p>
<p>Main Fiction: &#8220;Old Paint&#8221; by Megan Lindholm 26:30</p>
<p><em>I was only nine when it happened, so I may not have the details absolutely right. But I know the heart of my story, and the heart is always what matters in a tale like mine.</em></p>
<p>Megan Lindholm was born in Oakland California in 1952, and spent the first ten years of her life in California. She grew up in a house full of books, rich with lovely illustrated fairy tale volumes, the works of Kipling, Robert Louis Stevenson, Dumas, Shakespeare and other classics in poetry as well as prose. When she was a preteen, her family moved from the California suburbs to a house on the rural outskirts of Fairbanks, Alaska. It was a huge change in lifestyle, from potato chips and avocado dip to growing potatoes and helping butcher moose. She loved the more rustic lifestyle, the opportunity to have wolf-hybrid dogs and access to undeveloped forest for long runs with her dogs.</p>
<p>In 1970, she married and moved with her husband Fred to Kodiak, Alaska. They lived in a very small village called Chiniak near a missile tracking site. Although she had been a writer since her early teens, at this time she first began to attempt selling her stories. She worked as a village correspondent for the local newspaper, and marketed her stories, with limited success, to children’s magazines. Over the next twelve years, she and her growing family spent time in Alaska, Idaho, and Hawaii. She sold stories to magazines such as Humpty Dumpty, Jack and Jill, Highlights for Children, and designed stories to be used in the Science Research Associates (SRA) graduated reading program. She won a grant from the Alaska State Council for the Arts for the coming of age story, “The Poaching” but her interest was turning more and more to fantasy.</p>
<p>In 1982, she sold her first fantasy novel, Harpy’s Flight. Ki and Vandien’s adventures continued in three more volumes (Luck of the Wheels, The Windsingers, and The Limbreth Gate.) Her other works included The Reindeer People, Wolf’s Brother, Alien Earth, Wizard of the Pigeons and a collaboration with Steven Brust for The Gypsy.</p>
<p>In 1995, her career as a novelist ended as she began to write epic fantasy under the pseudonym Robin Hobb, which she continues to do to this day. Her best known work is The Farseer Trilogy, and her most recent work as Hobb is The Fool’s Assassin (2014). As Megan Lindholm, her shorter works such as “A Touch of Lavender” was a finalist for both the Hugo and the Nebula award. “Silver Lady and the Fortyish Man” was also a Nebula finalist. Over the years, she has continued to write short stories as Megan Lindholm. Other short works recently published include “Neighbors” in the anthology Dangerous Women, edited by George R R Martin and Gardner Dozois. This anthology recently won the World Fantasy Award for Best Anthology.</p>

She won a grant from the Alaska State Council for the Arts for the coming of age story, “The Poaching” but her interest was turning more and more to fantasy.

                In 1982, she sold her first fantasy novel, Harpy’s Flight. Ki and Vandien’s adventures continued in three more volumes (Luck of the Wheels, The Windsingers, and The Limbreth Gate.) Her other works included The Reindeer People, Wolf’s Brother, Alien Earth, Wizard of the Pigeons and a collaboration with Steven Brust for The Gypsy.

                In 1995, her career as a novelist ended as she began to write epic fantasy under the pseudonym Robin Hobb, which she continues to do to this day. Her best known work is The Farseer Trilogy, and her most recent work as Hobb is The Fool’s Assassin (2014). As Megan Lindholm, her shorter works such as “A Touch of Lavender” was a finalist for both the Hugo and the Nebula award. “Silver Lady and the Fortyish Man” was also a Nebula finalist. Over the years, she has continued to write short stories as Megan Lindholm. Other short works recently published include “Neighbors” in the anthology Dangerous Women, edited by George R R Martin and Gardner Dozois. This anthology recently won the World Fantasy Award for Best Anthology.

<p>“Do you dream of mammoths?” a talk-show host once asked me. I knew not to give him my first choice of answer; that would have enlightened his audience over the course of three and a half hours — so long as they had the basic grounding in biosciences required to understand it. I also knew enough to avoid my second answer, which was that his question was unintelligent, and that the entire interview had taken time I could have spent better in the laboratory.</p>

He is currently touring America with Much Ado About Nothing and has played many of Shakespeare&#8217;s leading roles.

<p>Music: The Wreck of the Cassie Dee by <a href="http://davidbradshawmusic.com/">David Bradshaw</a></p>
<p>Science News by J J Campanella</p>
<p>Main Fiction: &#8220;Bulk Food&#8221; by Peter Watts and <a href="http://www.lauriechanner.com/">Laurie Channer</a></p>
<p><span id="more-25674"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.rifters.com/" target="_blank"><b>Peter Watts</b></a> is a (former) scientist, author, and convicted felon who spent the first two decades of his adult life as a marine biologist. After fleeing academia for science fiction he became known for the habit of appending extensive technical bibliographies onto his novels; this both confers a veneer of credibility and covers his ass against nitpickers.  Described by the <em>Globe &amp; Mail</em> as &#8220;one of the very best [hard-sf writers] alive&#8221;, the overall effect of his prose is perhaps best summed up by critic James Nicoll: &#8220;Whenever I find my will to live becoming too powerful, I read Peter Watts&#8221;.</p>
<p>His debut novel (<em>Starfish</em>) was a NY Times Notable Book, while his most-recent-but-one (<em>Blindsight</em>)— a rumination on the utility of consciousness which, despite an unhealthy focus on space vampires, has become a required text in undergraduate courses ranging from philosophy to neuroscience— made the final ballot for numerous North American genre awards, winning exactly none of them. (It does, however, continue to win awards overseas, seven years later.) His shorter work has also picked up trophies in a variety of jurisdictions, notably a Hugo (possibly due to fan outrage over an altercation with US border guards in 2009) and a Shirley Jackson (possibly due to fan sympathy over nearly dying of flesh-eating disease in 2011).</p>
<p><em>Echopraxia</em>, a sort-of sequel to <em>Blindsight</em>, is only just out. History has not yet made its judgment.</p>

<p>Lyrics to The Wreck of the Cassie Dee</p>
<p>Come share a drink with me, now,</p>
<p>While the others are away</p>
<p>My mates all used to call me Stoker John</p>
<p>This resting makes me restless</p>
<p>So I’ll pass this time with you</p>
<p>And bore you with my yarns before I’m gone</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We used to work the ore run</p>
<p>Before the light-speeds flew</p>
<p>From Edwards Air to old Tranquiity</p>
<p>An atomic powered coffin numbered 1492</p>
<p>That we sentimental fools called “Cassie Dee”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I sweated in my silver suit</p>
<p>and tended to the piles</p>
<p>Cap’n Anty only smiled when things went wrong</p>
<p>Cassie barely held up</p>
<p>through the suborbital phase</p>
<p>and we prayed and cursed and prodded her along</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ore came from the main belt,</p>
<p>Ice and dust of every kind,</p>
<p>The bulk from Juno, Pallas, Cybele</p>
<p>Carried from the moon, then back with</p>
<p>Hardware and supplies,</p>
<p>Sometimes some pay or a little rum for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That was all there was for us</p>
<p>Between the earth and moon</p>
<p>A creaking ship and a job that didn’t end</p>
<p>The owners didn’t care so long</p>
<p>As cash and cargo flowed</p>
<p>Not one spare dime or damn on us to spend</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How many times did sun and earth</p>
<p>Spin ‘round us in the sky?</p>
<p>How many moons, I really couldn’t say</p>
<p>And when the siren sounded,</p>
<p>I paid barely any mind</p>
<p>Disaster, just like every other day</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Old Cassie’d gotten help she didn’t need</p>
<p>In breaking up</p>
<p>From a run-in with a drifting piece of junk</p>
<p>And I had to scramble into</p>
<p>my worn silvers at the call</p>
<p>For I’d dared to spend an hour in my bunk</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’d started our descent,</p>
<p>The hull collapsed, the piles leaked</p>
<p>The crew in radiation doomed to drown</p>
<p>As he locked me in the lifeboat,</p>
<p>Anty smiled and said to me,</p>
<p>“It’s a bust, John but we’ll try to hold ‘er down!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That was years ago, mind you,</p>
<p>Before the light speeds flew</p>
<p>When we had to do the ore run the long way</p>
<p>The atomics only made me sick,</p>
<p>Since I had my silvers on</p>
<p>Left in hospital bed now to this day</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m told they made a light-speed port</p>
<p>From the ore and goods we shipped</p>
<p>And a city stands at old Tranquility</p>
<p>Perhaps they spare a damn or prayer for 1492</p>
<p>And poor Anty’s crew, who called her</p>
<p>Cassie Dee…</p>

                Science News by J J Campanella

                Main Fiction: &quot;Bulk Food&quot; by Peter Watts and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lauriechanner.com/&quot;&gt;Laurie Channer&lt;/a&gt;



                &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rifters.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Peter Watts&lt;/a&gt; is a (former) scientist, author, and convicted felon who spent the first two decades of his adult life as a marine biologist. After fleeing academia for science fiction he became known for the habit of appending extensive technical bibliographies onto his novels; this both confers a veneer of credibility and covers his ass against nitpickers.  Described by the Globe &amp; Mail as &quot;one of the very best [hard-sf writers] alive&quot;, the overall effect of his prose is perhaps best summed up by critic James Nicoll: &quot;Whenever I find my will to live becoming too powerful, I read Peter Watts&quot;.

                His debut novel (Starfish) was a NY Times Notable Book, while his most-recent-but-one (Blindsight)— a rumination on the utility of consciousness which, despite an unhealthy focus on space vampires, has become a required text in undergraduate courses ranging from philosophy to neuroscience— made the final ballot for numerous North American genre awards, winning exactly none of them. (It does, however, continue to win awards overseas, seven years later.) His shorter work has also picked up trophies in a variety of jurisdictions, notably a Hugo (possibly due to fan outrage over an altercation with US border guards in 2009) and a Shirley Jackson (possibly due to fan sympathy over nearly dying of flesh-eating disease in 2011).

                Echopraxia, a sort-of sequel to Blindsight, is only just out. History has not yet made its judgment.

                Watts&#039;s work is available in 18 languages. A few years back he briefly returned to science with a postdoc in molecular genetics, but he really sucked at it.

                Narrator: Mark Nelson

                After getting a BA in Radio &amp; Television, I spent the next 28 years in Human Resources - the graveyard of useless degrees. After being laid-off by my last tech company after it was bought-out by a competitor and shut down, I decided to return to my useless roots, and have been narrating audiobooks since 2006.  My goal is to become the world’s oldest hikikomori.

                Lyrics to The Wreck of the Cassie Dee

                Come share a drink with me, now,

                While the others are away

                My mates all used to call me Stoker John

                This resting makes me restless

                So I’ll pass this time with you

                And bore you with my yarns before I’m gone



                We used to work the ore run

                Before the light-speeds flew

                From Edwards Air to old Tranquiity

                An atomic powered coffin numbered 1492

                That we sentimental fools called “Cassie Dee”



                I sweated in my silver suit

                and tended to the piles

                Cap’n Anty only smiled when things went wrong

                Cassie barely held up

                through the suborbital phase

                and we prayed and cursed and prodded her along



                Ore came from the main belt,

                Ice and dust of every kind,

                The bulk from Juno, Pallas, Cybele

                Carried from the moon, then back with

                Hardware and supplies,

                Sometimes some pay or a little rum for me.



                That was all there was for us

                Between the earth and moon

                A creaking ship and a job that didn’t end

                The owners didn’t care so long

                As cash and cargo flowed

                Not one spare dime or damn on us to spend



                How many times did sun and earth

                Spin ‘round us in the sky?

                How many moons, I really couldn’t say

                And when the siren sounded,

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s decided&#8230; we are going to walk Hadrian&#8217;s Wall.</p>
<p>Now this is the thing&#8230; you are more than welcome to join Gary Main and myself either here on the blog, or in person on the actual walk. If you think you might like to join us &#8211; well, that would be fantastic. Drop me an email: starshipsofa@gmail.com. We plan to visit the area this November to get a feel for the place and do a test walk.</p>
<p>As of now&#8230; and things can change &#8211; we aim to do the main walk over the spring of 2015 for (possibly the beginning of April) four days/three nights starting from Wallsend and heading west to finish at Bowness-On-Solway. Again this can all change but it&#8217;s at least penciled in&#8230; and it&#8217;s a thick pencil!</p>
<p>We have both got ourselves a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Hadrians-Wall-Path-Bowness---Solway/dp/1905864582/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1412018014&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=hadrians+wall">Hadrian&#8217;s Wall Path</a> by Henry Stedman as our initial guide book. Note: it is the first dead tree book I have bought in over five years.</p>

                Main Fiction: &quot;Ghost in the Machine&quot; by &lt;a href=&quot;http://ralphroberts.net/&quot;&gt;Ralph Roberts&lt;/a&gt;

                Marcus Teague sat hunched over in the cramped confines of the 16 GB USB thumb drive. The muscles of his mighty arms rippled as he cleaned his wizard&#039;s sword, running the polishing spell up and down the blade with precision.




                Ralph Roberts is a decorated Vietnam Veteran and worked with NASA during the Apollo moon program. He built his first personal computer in 1976 and has been writing about them and on them since his first published article “Down with Typewriters” in 1978. He has written over 100 books along with thousands of articles and short stories. His best sellers include the first U.S. book on computer viruses (which resulted in several appearances on national TV) and Classic Cooking with Coca-Cola®, a cookbook that has been in continuous print for the past 17 years and sold half a million copies. He is also a video producer with over 100 DVD titles now for sale nationally on places such as Amazon.com. He has also produced hundreds of hours of video for local TV in the Western North Carolina area and sold scripts to Hollywood producers. Recently, for Packt Publishing, Ralph wrote Celtx: Open Source Screenwriting Google App Inventor, Google Plus First Look and Yammer Starter. Ralph and his wife Pat live on a farm in the mountains of Western North Carolina with two horses.

<p>Interview: James Morrow</p>
<p>Main Fiction: Iron Shroud by <a href="http://jamesmorrow.info/">James Morrow</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jonathan Hobbwright cannot discourse upon the formic thoughts that flicker through the minds of ants, and he is similarly ignorant concerning the psyches of locusts, toads, moles, apes, and bishops, but he can tell you what it’s like to be in hell. The abyss has become his fixed abode. Perdition is now his permanent address. Although Jonathan’s eyes deliver only muddy and monochromatic images, his ears have acquired an uncommon acuity. Encapsulated head-to-toe in damnation’s carapace, he can hear the throbbing heart of a nearby rat, the caw of a proximate raven, the hiss of an immediate snake&#8221;.</p>
<p>James Morrow&#8217;s loopy historical novel, Galápagos Regained will see the publication in January of 2015. In the spirit of The Last Witchfinder (which chronicled the coming of the Enlightenment), this epic dramatizes the birth of the evolutionary worldview.</p>
<p>His heroine, Chloe Bathurst, gets a job as Charles Darwin&#8217;s zookeeper in 1848, well before the publication of On the Origin of Species. Eventually she finds herself in South America, heading for the Galápagos archipelago so she can collect her own evolutionary menagerie and thus win the Great God Contest: £10,000 to the first entrant who can prove or disprove the existence of God.</p>
<p>Narrator: Katherine Inskip</p>
<p>Katherine Inskip weighs galaxies for a living, and builds worlds in her spare time. She is addicted to chocolate and Japanese logic puzzles</p>

<p> Fact: Looking Back at Genre History by Amy H. Sturgis 14:00</p>
<p>Short Fiction 2: &#8220;You, In Emulation&#8221; by <a href="http://www.kathryncramer.com/">Kathryn Cramer</a> 26:00</p>
<p><em>&#8220;I checked you out of the library. You were due back in two weeks for synchronization, but I kept you out much longer, running up huge fines. The librarian was very nice and didn&#8217;t make me pay right away, but said that she had very little discretion; that the fines were set by the library system and your publisher.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Narrators: <a href="http://dennislanebooks.com/">Dennis M. Lane </a>and Tricia Glock</p>
<p>Dennis M. Lane is a Rhysling Award (2013 Short poem &#8211; &#8220;Blind Obedience&#8221;, 2013 Long Poem &#8211; &#8220;Grandfather&#8221;) and Dwarf Stars Award (2013 &#8220;Replacement&#8221;) nominated poet and writer of science fiction short stories and novels.</p>
<p>He was born in the monochrome days of the early sixties, deep in the industrial heartland of England. Coming of age during the Thatcher Years, the conflict that he experienced during the Steel Strike and the Teacher’s Strike played a great part in his political development.</p>
<p>In 1986 he travelled to rural Nigeria as a volunteer teacher and this lead to a long career working in international development, which continues to this day.</p>
<p>He has lived in seven countries across Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific, each country making its own impact upon him. He has finally settled in South Africa where he has now lived for almost ten years.</p>
<p>Dennis M Lane’s writing ranges from poetry, which covers a variety of themes from the personal to the political, and are written in a range of styles and forms; through short stories; to longer forms. His first poetry collection “8 Million Stories” was published in November 2010. A collection of science fiction short stories, poetry and flash fiction, &#8220;The Poring Dark&#8221;, was published in September 2012. His first novel “Talatu”, a Young Adult Science Fiction tale, was published in March 2013.</p>
<p>His second novel was published in August 2013. &#8220;The King&#8217;s Jewel&#8221;, the first of The Helix Key Series, is a Young Adult novel best described as Quantum Leap meets Assassin&#8217;s Creed with a backbone of Stargate; and is populated by his own ancestors (going back as far as the time of Christ!).</p>
<p>Outside of his writing Dennis presents a monthly Film Review on the Hugo award winning StarShipSofa podcast, writes articles for the Limebird Writers site, cooks, plays the harmonica and spends far too much time watching football.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tricia hides behind her writing the way a film star hides behind the camera – it should work, but it doesn’t.  She has family and pets, but doesn’t think it relevant to mention them.</p>

                &quot;I checked you out of the library. You were due back in two weeks for synchronization, but I kept you out much longer, running up huge fines. The librarian was very nice and didn&#039;t make me pay right away, but said that she had very little discretion; that the fines were set by the library system and your publisher.&quot;



                Narrators: &lt;a href=&quot;http://dennislanebooks.com/&quot;&gt;Dennis M. Lane &lt;/a&gt;and Tricia Glock

                Dennis M. Lane is a Rhysling Award (2013 Short poem - &quot;Blind Obedience&quot;, 2013 Long Poem - &quot;Grandfather&quot;) and Dwarf Stars Award (2013 &quot;Replacement&quot;) nominated poet and writer of science fiction short stories and novels.

                He was born in the monochrome days of the early sixties, deep in the industrial heartland of England. Coming of age during the Thatcher Years, the conflict that he experienced during the Steel Strike and the Teacher’s Strike played a great part in his political development.

                In 1986 he travelled to rural Nigeria as a volunteer teacher and this lead to a long career working in international development, which continues to this day.

                He has lived in seven countries across Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific, each country making its own impact upon him. He has finally settled in South Africa where he has now lived for almost ten years.

                Dennis M Lane’s writing ranges from poetry, which covers a variety of themes from the personal to the political, and are written in a range of styles and forms; through short stories; to longer forms.</itunes:summary>

<p>Main Fiction: &#8220;The Prelate&#8217;s Commission&#8221; by <a href="http://www.well-builtcity.com/">Jeffrey Ford</a> 03:30</p>
<p><em>&#8220;<span style="color: #444444;">The new fresco that graced the inner dome of the Cathedral of St. Elovisus was a masterpiece of perspective and illusion—the fall of the rebel angels into hell. They hurtled downward through an aquamarine sky swirled with pale pink clouds, their feathers disintegrating in the descent, their features growing ever more monstrous. Some, just ejected from paradise, appeared small and vastly distant, while the progressively larger ones took on weight and velocity. The largest seemed just above the viewer, desperately clawing the sky, eyes wide with the discovery of gravity, about to slam into the marble floor, which was inlaid with a deep and spiraling scene of Hell. At the center of the inner dome above was an illuminated circle where one could glimpse, as if from the bottom of a well, the enormous, angry face of God.&#8221;</span></em></p>
<p>Jeffrey Ford is the author of three previous story collections and eight previous novels, including the Edgar<small style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit;"><span style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit;">®</span></small> Award-winning <em style="font-weight: inherit;">The Girl in the Glass</em> and the Shirley Jackson Award-winning <em style="font-weight: inherit;">The Shadow Year</em>.

<p><strong><em>Acknowledgement</em></strong><br />
<em>I would like to acknowledge the law firm of Campbell Gatewood Adams for providing the use of a Weyman magnetic resonance facility to record, and a PeerSource account to upload, this message.</em><br />
<strong><em>Project Goals</em></strong><br />
<em>We are trying to fund an application, to be filed on my behalf, for an Order to Show Cause under Article 70 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules of the New York Sector Code, seeking a writ of habeas corpus for a non-human being.</em><br />
<em>Let me introduce myself. I am a Yudovich Robotics servient. My name is Ellen R.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Samuel Peralta is a physicist and storyteller. He has produced and supported scores of crowd-sourced films, including projects based on Daniel H. Wilson’s The Nostalgist, and Stephen King’s Big Driver and Rest Stop. He has been recognized with awards from the BBC, UK Poetry Society, Digital Literature Institute, Palanca Memorial Awards for Literature, and shortlists for the League of Canadian Poets, Elgin Award, ARC Poem of the Year, and Goodreads Best Small Press Books and Chapbooks. The titles in his Semaphore series—Sonata Vampirica, Sonnets from the Labrador, How More Beautiful You Are, Tango Desolado, and War and Ablution—all topped the Amazon Kindle Hot New Releases charts, and ranked at the top of the Bestseller lists, for poetry. More recently, the fiction titles set in his Labyrinth world—including Trauma Room and Hereafter—have begun to gain popular attention. Liberty is the latest addition to this universe.</p>

<p>Veronica Belmont is the host of the Sword &amp; Laser YouTube show and podcast, now in its seventh year. The Sword &amp; Laser anthology, edited by Veronica and Tom Merritt, was published in 2014. As an Internet and TV presenter, you may have seen her as the host of the Doctor Who 50th Anniversary live show and Gizmodo: The Gadget Testers on BBC America; or on Tekzilla, Fact or Fictional, Game On, and countless other web shows and podcasts. This is her first work of published fiction. She hopes there will be more.</p>

<p>Ibba Armancas is a nomadic screenwriter/director mostly based in Seattle, WA. The trailer for her first feature film is due to release September 2014, and she currently works as Head Writer for a new show by Zombie Orpheus Entertainment (http://zombieorpheus.com/). She regularly makes terrible life choices in pursuit of stories, and is very bad at finding time to work on her website. You can follow her exploits on Twitter @IbbaArmancas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adam Pracht is assistant editor of StarShipSofa. In real life, he is public relations coordinator for McPherson College in Kansas, will start this fall as a part-time journalism teacher for the local high school, and is now pursuing his master&#8217;s degree in K-12 education from McPherson College. Adam is extremely tired. He&#8217;s the author of a disappointingly slim volume of short stories titled &#8220;Frame Story: Seven Stories of Sci-Fi &amp; Fantasy, Horror &amp; Humor.&#8221; If you&#8217;d like to buy a paperback copy, please contact him, as the remaining copies are currently lounging comfortably in a dusty box.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Veronica “V.” Giguere is a voice artist and author who has appeared in a variety of audio projects and podcasts covering genres such as science fiction, erotica, fantasy, horror, romance, and steampunk. She is a coauthor of the Secret World Chronicles podcast novel series, as well as the narrator and voice for a plethora of heroes and villains therein. She has voiced spoiled supervillains, tempting demons, fierce pirates, anxious technomancers, smart-mouthed shapeshifters,<br />
suspicious journalists, Greek goddesses, white foxlings, virus-laden robots, and a young woman facing an odd spider infestation.</p>

<p>Short Fiction: 2014 Hugo Nominee &#8211; &#8220;If You Were a Dinosaur, My Love,&#8221; by <a href="http://rachelswirsky.com/">Rachel Swirsky</a> 10:20</p>
<p><em><span style="color: #3c3c3c;">If you were a dinosaur, my love, then you would be a T-Rex. You’d be a small one, only five feet, ten inches, the same height as human-you. You’d be fragile-boned and you’d walk with as delicate and polite a gait as you could manage on massive talons. Your eyes would gaze gently from beneath your bony brow-ridge.</span> </em></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">Rachel Swirsky holds an MFA in fiction from the Iowa Writers Workshop and attended Clarion West in 2005. Her short fiction has appeared in numerous magazines and anthologies and been nominated for the Hugo Award and World Fantasy Award, among others. &#8220;If You Were a Dinosaur, My Love&#8221; received the Nebula Award for short story in 2013. She is not a dinosaur, nor is she married to one, but she encourages all paleontologists and people in related fields to get on recreating some, because come on, that would be really cool.</span></p>

<p>Main Fiction: &#8220;Shatterdown&#8221; by <a href="http://www.zanzjan.net/">Suzanne Palmer</a> 20:00</p>
<p><em><span style="color: #000000;">Four moons dotted the distant horizon, pale ghosts half-lost in shadow and framed on either side by Cjoi’s heavy black boots propped up against the observation glass. She slouched in her chair, mute earpiece dangling at the base of her neck, her eyes and attention on the gas giant below. Ammonia clouds seethed and spun endless bright rivers of gold across its radiant face, deadly and compelling. Her dive-sphere was rolled toward the oncoming night, engines in stand-by, no interior lights except the tiny blips of critical systems to break the spell.</span></em></p>

<div id="yui_3_16_0_1_1405370558136_7951" class="body undoreset">Suzanne Palmer is a Linux system administrator, writer, and artist who lives in the wild hills of western Massachusetts somewhere amidst the moose and mosquitoes. A lifelong reader of science fiction and fantasy, she started writing on a dare and promptly became addicted to it. She is an alumna and former staff member of the Viable Paradise Writer&#8217;s Workshop, and has published stories in Asimov&#8217;s, Interzone, and Black Static, among other places. She is currently putting the finishing touches of a novel, set in the same universe as much of her short SF, and is already busily plotting the next. (Stuff will blow up in it, certainly.) She will also be at Worldcon in London in August, and hopes people will say hello.</div>

<p><em>Among those who could accurately judge such things, it was generally acknowledged that Rosemary’s library was the finest of its kind in the entire archipelago.</em></p>
<p><i>Rosemary was justifiably proud of it. Begun by her great-grandfather, it had passed down through the family, with each generation adding to the collection— at considerable personal expense.

Everyone on Earth did. Everyone with any sense of lab safety anyway. Never assume any liquid is just water. When you say “I always document my experiments as I go along,” enough water falls to test, but not so much that you have to mop up the lab. Which lie doesn’t matter.

<p>Main Fiction: &#8220;The Firewall and the Door&#8221; by <a href="http://seanmcmullen.net.au/">Sean McMullen</a></p>
<p>​<em>Entanglement technology had brought the final frontier as close as the living room. All we had to do was get an uncrewed probe out to whatever was to be explored, and the entangled telepresence established in its computers would provide practically instant communication. Everything was easy. Too easy. People took the wonders for granted until something went spectacularly wrong.</em><br />
Sean sold his first stories in the late 1980s and has become one of Australia&#8217;s top Science Fiction and Fantasy authors. In the late 90s he established himself in the American market, and his work has been translated into Polish, French, Japanese and other languages.The settings for Sean&#8217;s work range from the Roman Empire, through Medieval Europe, to cities of the distant future. His work is a mixture of romance, invention and adventure, while populated by strange but dynamic characters.</p>
<p>His novelette Eight Miles was runner-up in the 2011 Hugo Awards and his next novelette Ninety Thousand Horses won the Analog Readers&#8217; Award in 2013.</p>

<p>Narrator: Logan Waterman</p>
<p>Logan has a degree in Technical Theatre from California State University, and has worked in many theatres, large and small, professional and amateur. He has also worked for Apple computers, sold hot tubs and comic books, and prepared court documents. He has taught sword-fighting for the stage, and ran lights for a local band, until they broke up.<br />
He currently works, tangentially, for the legal system, watches a lot of science fiction television, listens to a lot of podcasts, and reads a lot of science fiction novels. And comic books. He hopes to make a bit of money from voice acting and narration someday.<br />

<p><em>Whether Caleb and Crane came out to California separate and partnered up later on—or whether they knew each other from some eastern clime and made their way westward as a pair—well, who the devil can tell and what the devil does it matter? Suffice it to say that whether they came to their claim as partners or came to it alone, Crane and Caleb came the same as all the rest of ’em: maybe overland on some slow-rolling desperation caravan from Oxford, Mississippi or Albany, New York, jouncing on rutted wheels through Salt Lake, Deadwood, Barstow; maybe aboard a leaky old cutter, or rounding down around Cape Horn, dipping and rolling on the seasick waves.</em></p>
<p><em>Some way or other, the point is, they came.</em></p>

<p>Main Fiction: &#8220;The Philip Sydney Game&#8221; by <a href="http://www.goblinmercantileexchange.com/">Alan DeNiro</a></p>
<p>This narration of &#8220;The Philip Sydney Game&#8221; was created by and appears courtesy of Audible. The complete Audible audiobook of &#8220;Tyrannia and Other Renditions&#8221; &#8211; in which this narration first appeared &#8211; may be downloaded from <a href="www.audible.com/StarShipSofa">www.audible.com/StarShipSofa</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Several years ago, I started writing a story about a man who was flying into Minneapolis-St. Paul and saw a car crash from above. The plane was about a thousand feet up and was descending when he saw the crash. It was late at night, a red-eye flight, so he could only see the headlights and tail-lights, and the faintest silhouettes of the cars. One car began to swerve and careened into the opposite lane, grazing the driver’s side of an oncoming car, which halted. The car that caused the accident stalled for a bit but then accelerated again and kept moving forward. While the hit car was motionless on the road, another car from behind slammed into the back of it, pushing it off the side over a small embankment that the passenger could barely discern. Then that car jerked backwards and kept driving as well.</em></p>
<p><em>The road this took place on was just an ordinary road connecting one suburb to another. There were a few buildings–warehouses, maybe–close to where the crash took place, which were unlit. And a pond in the back of one of them, weakly shimmering. This was what the passenger saw, terrified. The plane continued its landing procedure and made a swooping turn toward the airport, flying away from the scene.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alan was born in Erie, Pa., in 1973, took 12 years of Catholic school, earned a B.A. in English from the <a href="http://www.wooster.edu/">College of Wooster</a>, MFA in poetry writing from the University of Virginia. He is author of two poetry chapbooks: <i>The Black Hare</i> and <i>Atari Ecologues</i>. He also released a 165-page poem, <em>The Stations</em>, for free in the wilds of the Internet with a pretty loose creative commons license.</p>
<p>His first short story collection, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1931520178/">Skinny Dipping in the Lake of the Dead</a>, came out from <a href="http://www.lcrw.net/">Small Beer Press</a> in June 2006. In 2009, Ballantine/Spectra published his novel <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Total-Oblivion-More-Less-Novel/dp/0553592548/">Total Oblivion, More or Less</a>.

<p>Narrator: <a href="http://www.jorjeanavo.com">Jorjeana Marie</a></p>
<p>Jorjeana Marie is one of those rare talents that can somehow stretch from being raw, gripping and emotionally thrilling in one moment to delightfully fun, care-free and hilarious in the next.  With extensive experience in New York City and Regional theatre as well as professionally touring as a stand-up comedienne opening for Richard Lewis and Louis Anderson, this quirky actress has moved to roles in film, television and all areas of voice-over. Her work in animation, video games, commercials, promos and audiobooks has meant performing with and collaborating on projects with icons such as Eliot Gould, Jim Belushi, and Steven Spielberg.  From sweet seven year-old boys and snarky teenagers to wild animals and aliens from the planet Zabu, Jorjeana creates real, honest characters right alongside her girl next door and everywoman roles.</p>
<p>She has been the &#8220;voice of&#8221; many campaigns and even a network or two.  She is rapidly becoming known for her kids voices-particularly her boys and her creature voices and animal sounds.</p>

                Main Fiction: &quot;The Philip Sydney Game&quot; by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goblinmercantileexchange.com/&quot;&gt;Alan DeNiro&lt;/a&gt;

                This narration of &quot;The Philip Sydney Game&quot; was created by and appears courtesy of Audible. The complete Audible audiobook of &quot;Tyrannia and Other Renditions&quot; - in which this narration first appeared - may be downloaded from &lt;a href=&quot;www.audible.com/StarShipSofa&quot;&gt;www.audible.com/StarShipSofa&lt;/a&gt;.



                Several years ago, I started writing a story about a man who was flying into Minneapolis-St. Paul and saw a car crash from above. The plane was about a thousand feet up and was descending when he saw the crash. It was late at night, a red-eye flight, so he could only see the headlights and tail-lights, and the faintest silhouettes of the cars. One car began to swerve and careened into the opposite lane, grazing the driver’s side of an oncoming car, which halted. The car that caused the accident stalled for a bit but then accelerated again and kept moving forward. While the hit car was motionless on the road, another car from behind slammed into the back of it, pushing it off the side over a small embankment that the passenger could barely discern. Then that car jerked backwards and kept driving as well.

                The road this took place on was just an ordinary road connecting one suburb to another. There were a few buildings–warehouses, maybe–close to where the crash took place, which were unlit. And a pond in the back of one of them, weakly shimmering. This was what the passenger saw, terrified. The plane continued its landing procedure and made a swooping turn toward the airport, flying away from the scene.



                Alan was born in Erie, Pa., in 1973, took 12 years of Catholic school, earned a B.A. in English from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wooster.edu/&quot;&gt;College of Wooster&lt;/a&gt;, MFA in poetry writing from the University of Virginia. He is author of two poetry chapbooks: The Black Hare and Atari Ecologues. He also released a 165-page poem, The Stations, for free in the wilds of the Internet with a pretty loose creative commons license.

                His first short story collection, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1931520178/&quot;&gt;Skinny Dipping in the Lake of the Dead&lt;/a&gt;, came out from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lcrw.net/&quot;&gt;Small Beer Press&lt;/a&gt; in June 2006. In 2009, Ballantine/Spectra published his novel &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Total-Oblivion-More-Less-Novel/dp/0553592548/&quot;&gt;Total Oblivion, More or Less&lt;/a&gt;. His second story collection, &lt;a href=&quot;http://smallbeerpress.com/forthcoming/2013/03/14/tyrannia-and-other-renditions/&quot;&gt;Tyrannia&lt;/a&gt;, came out from Small Beer Press in October 2013. In addition to fiction he also writes poetry, reviews, essays, and interactive fiction.

                Married to &lt;a href=&quot;http://32degrees.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;Kristin Livdahl&lt;/a&gt;, human being and writer extraordinaire. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goblinmercantileexchange.com/about-me/?page_id=692&quot;&gt;Saga of the Raiding Team&lt;/a&gt; is a story of hers. They have two beautiful twins, Alessandra and Tobias, and three cats and a dog.

                “What time does the clock have, Charlie?”

                Mary looked left, dark, bobbed hair brushing her shoulders. She heard him mutter then carefully shut the doors, locking the timepieces away, before walking around to face her, his little tin feet clicking softly  against the wooden floor.

                “12 May 1923. Six pm.”

<p>They ran the girl down, in the grey light of dawn: a ring of copper-mailed horsemen, racing after her until her exhaustion finally felled her.</p>
<p>Yudhyana sat on his horse, shivering in the cold morning air, and thought of home—of the narrow, spice-filled streets of Rasamuri, and of his daughters shrieking with delight as he raced them in the courtyard. Anything to prevent him from focusing on what was happening.</p>

You can vote for the BSFA awards <a href="http://www.bsfa.co.uk/bsfa-2013-awards-voting-form/">here </a>by Monday, April 14.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Main Fiction 3: &#8220;Selkie Stories are for Losers&#8221; by <a href="http://sofiasamatar.com/">Sofia Samatar</a> 02:00</p>
<p><em>I hate selkie stories. They&#8217;re always about how you went up to the attic to look for a book, and you found a disgusting old coat and brought it downstairs between finger and thumb and said &#8220;What&#8217;s this?&#8221;, and you never saw your mom again.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sofia is the author of the novel <a href="http://sofiasamatar.com/Sofia%20writing.html">A Stranger in Olondria</a> (Small Beer Press, April 2013). She edits nonfiction and poetry for Interfictions: A Journal of Interstitial Arts. She generally feels torn between two things she loves in equal measure: clean diction/ornate prose; bleakness/romance; fiction/nonfiction; lyric/epic; reading/writing; solitude/society; here/elsewhere; orange/gray.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Main Fiction 4: &#8220;Spin&#8221; by <a href="http://www.ninaallan.co.uk/">Nina Allan</a> 22:40</p>
<p><em>Her father was not there to say goodbye. It was not unusual for him to get up early and take the boat out, but Layla knew that today it was deliberate, that he didn’t want to see her leave.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <itunes:summary>StarShipSofa is proud to present all four nominees in the &quot;Best Short Fiction&quot; category of the&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bsfa.co.uk/&quot;&gt; British Science Fiction Association&lt;/a&gt;! You can vote for the BSFA awards &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bsfa.co.uk/bsfa-2013-awards-voting-form/&quot;&gt;here &lt;/a&gt;by Monday, April 14.



                Main Fiction 3: &quot;Selkie Stories are for Losers&quot; by &lt;a href=&quot;http://sofiasamatar.com/&quot;&gt;Sofia Samatar&lt;/a&gt; 02:00

                I hate selkie stories. They&#039;re always about how you went up to the attic to look for a book, and you found a disgusting old coat and brought it downstairs between finger and thumb and said &quot;What&#039;s this?&quot;, and you never saw your mom again.



                Sofia is the author of the novel &lt;a href=&quot;http://sofiasamatar.com/Sofia%20writing.html&quot;&gt;A Stranger in Olondria&lt;/a&gt; (Small Beer Press, April 2013). She edits nonfiction and poetry for Interfictions: A Journal of Interstitial Arts. She generally feels torn between two things she loves in equal measure: clean diction/ornate prose; bleakness/romance; fiction/nonfiction; lyric/epic; reading/writing; solitude/society; here/elsewhere; orange/gray.



                Main Fiction 4: &quot;Spin&quot; by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ninaallan.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Nina Allan&lt;/a&gt; 22:40

                Her father was not there to say goodbye. It was not unusual for him to get up early and take the boat out, but Layla knew that today it was deliberate, that he didn’t want to see her leave.



                Nina was born in Whitechapel, London, grew up in the Midlands and West Sussex, and studied Russian literature at the University of Exeter and Corpus Christi College, Oxford. She wrote her first short story at the age of six. Recurring obsessions include old clocks and rare insects, forgotten manuscripts and abandoned houses.

                Her stories have appeared regularly in premier British speculative fiction magazines Interzone, Black Static and Crimewave, and have featured in the anthologies Best Horror of the Year #2, The Year’s Best SF #28 and The Year’s Best Science Fiction and Fantasy 2012 and 2013.  Her story ‘Angelus’ won the Aeon Award in 2007, and her short fiction has shown up on BFS and BSFA shortlists on several occasions.

                A first collection of her short fiction, A Thread of Truth, was published by Eibonvale Press in 2007, followed by her story cycle The Silver Wind in 2011. Her most recent books are the story collection Microcosmos (NewCon Press March 2013) the novella Spin (TTA Press 2013) and Stardust: The Ruby Castle Stories (PS Publishing April 2013).

<p>Main Fiction 1: &#8220;Saga&#8217;s Children&#8221; by <a href="http://ejswift.co.uk/">E.J. Swift</a> 2:30</p>
<p><em>You will have heard of our mother, the astronaut Saga Wärmedal. She is famous, and she is infamous. Her face, instantly recognizable, appears against lists of extraordinary feats, firsts and lasts and onlys. There are the pronounced cheekbones, the long jaw, that pale hair cropped close to the head. In formal portraits she looks enigmatic, but in images caught unaware &#8211; perhaps at some function, talking to the Administrator of the CSSA or the Moon Colony Premier; in situations, in fact, where we might imagine she would feel out of place &#8211; she is animated, smiling. In those pictures, it is possible to glimpse the feted adventurer who traversed the asteroid belt without navigational aid.</em></p>
<p><em>We knew her only once, on Ceres.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>E.J. is a writer of speculative fiction, represented by the Zeno Agency (<a href="http://zenoagency.com/" target="_blank">zenoagency.com</a>).</p>
<p>She&#8217;s inspired by writers who bring the extraordinary to the ordinary, and for as long as she can remember she&#8217;s been making up stories, from the ridiculous to the epic. Although her work has always contained elements of the fantastical, she came to writing science fiction almost by accident.</p>
<p>Her debut novel <em>Osiris</em> (Del Rey UK and Night Shade Books) is set in a far future ocean metropolis, a failed utopia whose inhabitants believe they live on the last city on earth. The second in the trilogy, <em>Cataveiro</em>, expands the series to explore the world beyond Osiris. The series will be completed in a third volume to be published in 2015.</p>
<p>Her short fiction has appeared in Interzone magazine and in anthologies including <em>The Best British Fantasy 2013</em> and <em>Pandemonium: The Lowest Heaven</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Main Fiction 2: &#8220;Boat in Shadows, Crossing&#8221; by <a href="http://toritruslow.com/">Tori Truslow</a> 28:00</p>
<p>Narration created by, and appears with permission of, &#8220;<a href="http://www.beneath-ceaseless-skies.com/">Beneath Ceaseless Skies</a>&#8221; podcast.</p>
<p><em>Come, let me whisper you a tale of the city where I was born, the Town Where Salt-Plums Grow. A summer tale: dark and succulent, with a bite of chill—the kind we love to tell on warm thick nights.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tori is a writer of strange fiction, currently living in the East of England. She was born in Hong Kong, grew up in Bangkok, and has since moved back and forth between here and there.</p>
<p>Tori is a graduate of the Warwick MA in Writing, and her stories and poems have appeared in a number of magazine and anthologies, including <em>Clockwork Phoenix 3</em>, <em>Stone Telling</em>, <em>Penning Perfumes </em>and <em>Beneath Ceaseless Skies</em>.<em> </em>Her work had been a finalist for the James White Award and the Parsec Award.</p>
<p>As well as being a writer, she also wears a number of other (related) hats. With Claire Trévien, she&#8217;s the co-editor of <a href="http://versekraken.com/">Verse Kraken</a>, a magazine for experimental, multimedia and cross-genre art of all kinds. She was Writer-in-Residence at Shrewsbury International School from 2008-2010, and has continued to run workshops and offers creative writing tuition since then. Currently, she&#8217;s running the <a href="http://nineworlds.co.uk/track/queer-fandom">Queer Fandom</a> track at London’s coolest new convention, <a href="http://nineworlds.co.uk/">Nine Worlds GeekFest</a>.</p>
<p>When she was four, Tori wanted to be a professional diorama-maker when she grew up; these days she thinks she&#8217;d like to be a genderfluid cyborg on Mars.</p>

                You will have heard of our mother, the astronaut Saga Wärmedal. She is famous, and she is infamous.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Coming up&#8230;</p>
<p>Mothering Sunday Special! (March 30 in the UK): Two stories of maternal angst.</p>
<p>Main Fiction 1: &#8220;Pause Time&#8221; by <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mslee/">Mary Soon Lee</a> 03:40</p>
<p><em>Twenty minutes into the transatlantic flight, Connor started wailing. Pauline cradled him in her arms. Then she rocked him, she offered him her breast, she sang to him; Connor continued to cry.</em></p>
<p><em>The man sitting on her right gave her a thin smile. “Did you forget the baby’s pauser code?”</em></p>
<p><em>“No,” Pauline mumbled, wishing she could sink through the floor into the cargo hold. “I’ve never used the pauser.”</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1992 Mary started writing and submitting short stories, mainly in the science fiction and fantasy genres. She has had over seventy stories published, including appearances in <i>The Year&#8217;s Best SF #4 and #5</i>, edited by David Hartwell; her story &#8220;Cause and Consequence&#8221; (Interzone #136, October 1998) won first place in the <i>Best of Soft SF Contest</i>.</p>
<p>She has two collections in print: a science fiction collection, <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mslee/ebb-tides.html">Ebb Tides and Other Tales</a>, and a fantasy collection, <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mslee/winter.html">Winter Shadows and Other Tales</a>. AB Word did the beautiful cover illustrations for both books.</p>
<p>In 2000, Mary began writing poetry as well as short stories, and her poetry credits include <a href="http://www.theamericanscholar.org/"><i>American Scholar</i></a>, <a href="http://www.iodinepoetryjournal.com/"><i>Iodine Poetry Journal</i></a>, <a href="http://www.mainstreetrag.com/"><i>Main Street Rag</i></a>, and the <i>Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</i>.</p>
<p>Fact: Science News by <a href="http://www.uvulaaudio.com/books.html">Jim Campanella</a> 32:00</p>
<p>Main Fiction 2: &#8220;Nanny&#8217;s Day&#8221; by <a href="http://www.leahcypess.com/about-me/">Leah Cypess</a></p>
<p>Copyright (c) by Leah Cypess</p>
<p><em>Everybody knows you don&#8217;t keep a nanny for more than three months. The agency even asked me, when I hired Steph, if I wanted to make an appointment to interview someone new in February. I actually laughed out loud &#8211; I can barely keep an appointment I make a </em>week <em>in advance &#8211; and I told them I would call.</em></p>
<p><em>Which I intended to. I really did.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Leah wrote her first story in first grade. The narrator was an ice-cream cone in the process of being eaten. In fourth grade, she wrote her first book, about a girl who gets shipwrecked on a desert island with her faithful and heroic dog (a rip-off of both The Black Stallion and all the Lassie movies, very impressive).</p>

                Mothering Sunday Special! (March 30 in the UK): Two stories of maternal angst.

                Main Fiction 1: &quot;Pause Time&quot; by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mslee/&quot;&gt;Mary Soon Lee&lt;/a&gt; 03:40

                Twenty minutes into the transatlantic flight, Connor started wailing. Pauline cradled him in her arms. Then she rocked him, she offered him her breast, she sang to him; Connor continued to cry.

                The man sitting on her right gave her a thin smile. “Did you forget the baby’s pauser code?”

                “No,” Pauline mumbled, wishing she could sink through the floor into the cargo hold. “I’ve never used the pauser.”



                In 1992 Mary started writing and submitting short stories, mainly in the science fiction and fantasy genres. She has had over seventy stories published, including appearances in The Year&#039;s Best SF #4 and #5, edited by David Hartwell; her story &quot;Cause and Consequence&quot; (Interzone #136, October 1998) won first place in the Best of Soft SF Contest.

                She has two collections in print: a science fiction collection, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mslee/ebb-tides.html&quot;&gt;Ebb Tides and Other Tales&lt;/a&gt;, and a fantasy collection, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mslee/winter.html&quot;&gt;Winter Shadows and Other Tales&lt;/a&gt;. AB Word did the beautiful cover illustrations for both books.

                In 2000, Mary began writing poetry as well as short stories, and her poetry credits include &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theamericanscholar.org/&quot;&gt;American Scholar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iodinepoetryjournal.com/&quot;&gt;Iodine Poetry Journal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mainstreetrag.com/&quot;&gt;Main Street Rag&lt;/a&gt;, and the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.

                Main Fiction 2: &quot;Nanny&#039;s Day&quot; by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.leahcypess.com/about-me/&quot;&gt;Leah Cypess&lt;/a&gt;

                Copyright (c) by Leah Cypess

                Everybody knows you don&#039;t keep a nanny for more than three months. The agency even asked me, when I hired Steph, if I wanted to make an appointment to interview someone new in February. I actually laughed out loud - I can barely keep an appointment I make a week in advance - and I told them I would call.

                Which I intended to. I really did.



                Leah wrote her first story in first grade. The narrator was an ice-cream cone in the process of being eaten. In fourth grade, she wrote her first book, about a girl who gets shipwrecked on a desert island with her faithful and heroic dog (a rip-off of both The Black Stallion and all the Lassie movies, very impressive).

                After selling her first story (Temple of Stone) while in high school, she gave in to her mother’s importuning to be practical and majored in biology at  Brooklyn College. She then went to Columbia Law School and practiced law for almost two years at Debevoise &amp; Plimpton LLP, a large law firm in New York City. She kept writing and submitting in her spare time, and finally, a mere 15 years after her first short story acceptance, she sold her first novel to Greenwillow Books (HarperCollins). Her most recent novel, Death Sworn, is about a sorceress forced to serve as magic tutor to a secret sect of assassins. It was published by HarperCollins in March 2014.

                She lives in Brookline, Massachusetts (right outside of Boston) with her husband Aaron, a researcher and doctor at the Joslin Diabetes Center, and their three children.

<p>Narrator: <a href="http://misterkincaid.wordpress.com/">Jack Kincaid</a></p>
<p>Jack Kincaid is a multitalented creative person. He is an author, an audio producer, a voice actor, a sound designer, and a pragmatic musician, among other things.</p>
<p>He writes speculative fiction with an emphasis on the strange, the eerie, and the mysterious. Having amassed a bank of long-form works, he is an experienced novelist, but did not pursue publication for many years. He has since returned to his novel work and is in the process of revising the works in his bank.</p>
<p>Recent ebook releases on amazon.com include the science fiction novelette, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sound-Silence-Edict-Zero-Universe-ebook/dp/B00F7V4LKM">THE SOUND OF SILENCE</a>, and his horror novels, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HLPMDNO">HOAD’S GRIM</a> and KALTENGANGER (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HX0CEEU">Kindle</a> | <a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/kaltenganger-jack-kincaid/1118137063?ean=2940148129738">Nook</a> | <a href="http://store.kobobooks.com/en-US/ebook/kaltenganger">Kobo</a>).</p>
<p>Though short stories are unusual events for him, he had a handful published in such venues as Insidious Reflections Magazine, Surreal Magazine, and the paperback anthology ‘Exit Laughing’ from Hellbound Books.</p>
<p>Founder of Slipgate Nine Entertainment, Jack is the producer and creator of the modern-styled audio drama series “Edict Zero – FIS”. Taking his first big step into the realm of science fiction, he has cultivated this cyberpunk tale since early 2010. He hopes his writerly and actor instincts, combined with his interests in music and the art of sound in all its forms, will be the perfect storm for his new creative pursuits with the modern style of audio drama.</p>

                Robin Wasserman is the author of several books for children and young adults, including The Waking Dark, The Book of Blood and Shadow, the Cold Awakening Trilogy, Hacking Harvard, and the Seven Deadly Sins series, which was adapted into a popular television miniseries. Her essays and short fiction have appeared in several anthologies as well as The Atlantic and The New York Times. A former children’s book editor, she is on the faculty of the low-residency MFA program at Southern New Hampshire University. She lives and writes (and frequently procrastinates) in Brooklyn, New York. Find out more about her at &lt;a href=&quot;http://robinwasserman.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;robinwasserman.com&lt;/a&gt; or follow her on Twitter @robinwasserman

                Narrator: &lt;a href=&quot;http://misterkincaid.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;Jack Kincaid&lt;/a&gt;

                Jack Kincaid is a multitalented creative person. He is an author, an audio producer, a voice actor, a sound designer, and a pragmatic musician, among other things.

                He writes speculative fiction with an emphasis on the strange, the eerie, and the mysterious. Having amassed a bank of long-form works, he is an experienced novelist, but did not pursue publication for many years. He has since returned to his novel work and is in the process of revising the works in his bank.

                Recent ebook releases on amazon.com include the science fiction novelette, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Sound-Silence-Edict-Zero-Universe-ebook/dp/B00F7V4LKM&quot;&gt;THE SOUND OF SILENCE&lt;/a&gt;, and his horror novels, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HLPMDNO&quot;&gt;HOAD’S GRIM&lt;/a&gt; and KALTENGANGER (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HX0CEEU&quot;&gt;Kindle&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/kaltenganger-jack-kincaid/1118137063?ean=2940148129738&quot;&gt;Nook&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.kobobooks.com/en-US/ebook/kaltenganger&quot;&gt;Kobo&lt;/a&gt;).

                Though short stories are unusual events for him, he had a handful published in such venues as Insidious Reflections Magazine, Surreal Magazine, and the paperback anthology ‘Exit Laughing’ from Hellbound Books.

                Founder of Slipgate Nine Entertainment, Jack is the producer and creator of the modern-styled audio drama series “Edict Zero – FIS”. Taking his first big step into the realm of science fiction, he has cultivated this cyberpunk tale since early 2010. He hopes his writerly and actor instincts, combined with his interests in music and the art of sound in all its forms, will be the perfect storm for his new creative pursuits with the modern style of audio drama.

                He is also known for the horror podcast audiobook drama, “Hoad’s Grim” (2008-2009), and as an influential figure in the art of machinima with his early alter-ego work, “The Seal of Nehahra”, a three-plus hour machinima piece that was released in 2000 with an multi-episode game add-on for Id Software’s “Quake” (1).

<p>Main Fiction: &#8220;This Villain You Must Create&#8221; by <a href="http://mygeekblasphemy.com/">Carlie St. George</a> 06:00</p>
<p><em>Granite killed Mr. Malevolence on a Tuesday. In his defense, Mr. Malevolence had been trying to destroy the entire world at the time.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Carlie is a writer, a pop culture geek, a math class survivor, and a silly hat enthusiast. She&#8217;s a 2012 graduate of Clarion West Writer&#8217;s Workshop.</p>
<p>She also writes rather lengthy film critiques on My Geek Blasphemy, each dosed with a healthy pinch of snark and (hopefully) a dash of awesome.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Narrator: Adam Pracht</p>
<p>Adam is assistant editor of StarShipSofa, usually throwing it all together just in time. He works full time as public relations coordinator for McPherson College in Kansas. He also writes short genre fiction, does the odd narration (in all senses of the word odd) and was a finalist in the Stuff You Should Know podcast horror fiction contest.</p>

                Main Fiction: &quot;This Villain You Must Create&quot; by &lt;a href=&quot;http://mygeekblasphemy.com/&quot;&gt;Carlie St. George&lt;/a&gt; 06:00

                Granite killed Mr. Malevolence on a Tuesday. In his defense, Mr. Malevolence had been trying to destroy the entire world at the time.



                Carlie is a writer, a pop culture geek, a math class survivor, and a silly hat enthusiast. She&#039;s a 2012 graduate of Clarion West Writer&#039;s Workshop.

                She also writes rather lengthy film critiques on My Geek Blasphemy, each dosed with a healthy pinch of snark and (hopefully) a dash of awesome.



                Narrator: Adam Pracht

                Adam is assistant editor of StarShipSofa, usually throwing it all together just in time. He works full time as public relations coordinator for McPherson College in Kansas. He also writes short genre fiction, does the odd narration (in all senses of the word odd) and was a finalist in the Stuff You Should Know podcast horror fiction contest.</itunes:summary>

<p>A few days ago I got an email from Bruce Bethke. Here is said email:</p>
<p><em>Hi Tony,</em></p>
<p><em>M. David Blake&#8217;s 2014 Campbellian Anthology is (at last!) released. This mighty magnum opus is now available for download at the following links &#8212; and best of all, it&#8217;s not merely FREE, it&#8217;s *DRM-FREE*. Featuring more than 860,000 words of fiction by 111 authors, the 2014 Campbellian Anthology is&#8230;.big. Really, really, big.</em></p>
<p><em>Bruce.</em></p>
<p>I was more than happy to help Bruce and fingers crossed I can get an interview up soon with the editor M. David Blake. Two days later I get another email from Bruce&#8230; and I just had to smile &#8211; a writers dream turned into a nightmare! Here is said email:<span style="line-height: 1.5em; font-size: 0.8em;"><br />
</span></p>
<div><em>Tony,</em></div>
<div><em>The 2014 Campbellian Anthology has surpassed &#8220;monster&#8221; and become a freakin&#8217; kaiju. Nearly 9,000 downloads in the 24-hour period that ended at midnight GMT. More than 2,800 downloads in the hour and 15 minutes since.</em></div>
<p><em>Any chance you&#8217;d be willing to host a copy of the files? I&#8217;m worried that our web server won&#8217;t hold up under the strain.</em></p>
<p><em>Thanks,</em><br />
<em>Bruce</em></p>
<p>Now I don&#8217;t get many of those email. I bet every budding writer would love to experiance server overload.</p>
<p>So, the StarShipSofa has stepped in and we are now helpling to take the strain off Bruce&#8217;s servers. And here&#8217;s why its good thing. Everyone appearing in this book agreed to waive all fees, and some even had to get their publishers to waive embargo clauses and the like &#8212; and the best part is, this book is not merely free, it&#8217;s <i>DRM-FREE</i>.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s only available until the close of the Hugo voting period. So, grab your copy now!</p>
<p><em>Sorry, the anthology is no longer available!</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Descartes&#8217; Stepchildren” by <a href="https://my.vanderbilt.edu/robertscherrer/">Robert Scherrer</a> 16:20</p>
<p>Robert Scherrer is Professor and Chair of the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Vanderbilt University.  His research area is cosmology, encompassing work on dark energy, dark matter, big bang nucleosynthesis, and the large-scale structure of the universe.  He is also the author of a quantum mechanics textbook and has published several popular science articles and science fiction short stories.</p>
<p><a href="http://sofanauts.com/">THE SOFANAUTS IS PROUD TO PRESENT A LECTURE FROM HARRY TURTLEDOVE</a></p>
<p>A big thank you to <a href="http://www.mcpherson.edu/">McPherson College</a> for allowing The Sofanauts to play this lecture.</p>
<p>Narrator: Logan Waterman</p>
<p>Logan has a degree in Technical Theatre from California State University, and has worked in many theatres, large and small, professional and amateur. He has also worked for Apple computers, sold hot tubs and comic books, and prepared court documents. He has taught sword-fighting for the stage, and run lights for a local band, until they broke up.</p>
<p>He currently works, tangentially, for the legal system, watches a lot of science fiction television, listens to a lot of podcasts, and reads a lot of science fiction novels. And comic books. He hopes to make a bit of money from voice acting and narration someday.</p>
<p>Logan currently lives in Northern California with Grendel, a huge black beast whose primary occupations are sleeping, and stalking the fish in the aquarium, and Morgana, a small fluffy Queen who rules her domain with an iron paw. The fish remain unimpressed.</p>

                &lt;a href=&quot;http://sofanauts.com/&quot;&gt;THE SOFANAUTS IS PROUD TO PRESENT A LECTURE FROM HARRY TURTLEDOVE&lt;/a&gt;

                A big thank you to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mcpherson.edu/&quot;&gt;McPherson College&lt;/a&gt; for allowing The Sofanauts to play this lecture.

                Narrator: Logan Waterman

                Logan has a degree in Technical Theatre from California State University, and has worked in many theatres, large and small, professional and amateur. He has also worked for Apple computers, sold hot tubs and comic books, and prepared court documents. He has taught sword-fighting for the stage, and run lights for a local band, until they broke up.

                He currently works, tangentially, for the legal system, watches a lot of science fiction television, listens to a lot of podcasts, and reads a lot of science fiction novels. And comic books. He hopes to make a bit of money from voice acting and narration someday.

                Logan currently lives in Northern California with Grendel, a huge black beast whose primary occupations are sleeping, and stalking the fish in the aquarium, and Morgana, a small fluffy Queen who rules her domain with an iron paw. The fish remain unimpressed.</itunes:summary>

<p>Interview: <a href="http://science.jpl.nasa.gov/people/Spilker/">Dr. Linda Spilker</a> &#8211; Cassini Project Scientist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory 09:20</p>
<p>Ken’s fiction has appeared in <em>F&amp;SF</em>, <em>Asimov’s</em>, <em>Analog</em>, <em>Strange Horizons</em>, <em>Lightspeed</em>, and <em>Clarkesworld</em>, among other places. He has won a Nebula, two Hugos, a World Fantasy Award, and a Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy Translation Award, and been nominated for the Sturgeon and the Locus Awards. He lives near Boston with his family.</p>
<p>Ken’s debut novel, <i>The Chrysanthemum and the Dandelion</i>, the first in a fantasy series, will be published by Simon &amp; Schuster’s new genre fiction imprint in 2015, along with a collection of short stories.</p>
<p>Main Fiction: “The Infill Trait” by <a href="http://ccfinlay.com/">C.C. Finlay</a> 49:30</p>
<p>C.C. Finlay has published half a dozen books and dozens of stories, been translated into several languages, and nominated for some awards.</p>
<p>You know, the usual.</p>
<p>Finlay believes that we tell stories to create purpose and find meaning.  The stories we tell about ourselves define our identity, the stories we enjoy reveal our hopes and aspirations, and the stories that we believe without question hide our deepest fears.</p>

<p>Short Fiction: &#8220;On Moonlit Wings&#8221; by <a href="anaealay.com">Anaea Lay</a> 04:00</p>
<p>Anaea Lay lives in Madison, Wisconsin where she sells Real Estate under a different name, writes, cooks, plays board games, spoils her cat, runs the <em>Strange Horizons </em>podcast, and plots to take over the world. Her work has appeared in places such as Lightspeed, Nightmare, Apex and Daily Science Fiction.  You can find her online at <a id="yui_3_13_0_rc_1_1_1382576954425_8832" href="http://anaealay.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">anaealay.com</a></p>
<p>Interview: <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/788517288/songs-from-the-former-county">David Bradshaw</a> 12:00</p>

<p>Main Fiction: &#8220;Joining the High Flyers&#8221; by <a href="http://www.iancreasey.com/">Ian Creasey</a> 29:00</p>
<p>Ian Creasey lives in Yorkshire, England. He&#8217;s published about fifty short<br />
stories in various magazines and anthologies, and in 2011 he published his<br />
debut collection, Maps of the Edge.</p>
<p>Narrators: <a href="http://dennislanebooks.com/">Dennis M. Lane</a> and Logan Waterman<a href="http://roseplusman.tumblr.com/"><br />
</a></p>
<p>StarShipSofa regulars will know Dennis Lane as the voice of the old movie film talk and his book &#8220;The Poring Dark&#8221; featured in First Chapters a while back. One thing that you might not know, is that Dennis is a frustrated actor. His mother took him to audition as von Trapp child in a local theatre and he was (in his words) the furthest thing from a little Austrian boy in town. Now he confines his acting to putting on silly voices in front of a microphone.</p>
<p>Logan has a degree in Technical Theatre from California State University, and has worked in many theatres, large and small, professional and amateur. He has also worked for Apple computers, sold hot tubs and comic books, and prepared court documents. He has taught sword-fighting for the stage, and ran lights for a local band, until they broke up.<br />
He currently works, tangentially, for the legal system, watches a lot of science fiction television, listens to a lot of podcasts, and reads a lot of science fiction novels. And comic books. He hopes to make a bit of money from voice acting and narration someday.<br />
Logan currently lives in Northern California with Grendel, a huge black beast whose primary occupations<br />
are sleeping, and stalking the fish in the aquarium, and Morgana, a small fluffy Queen who rules her domain with an iron paw. The fish remain unimpressed.</p>

His fiction has been reprinted by the Dunesteef Audio Fiction Magazine and StarShipSofa, and his voice has been heard on two Escape Artists and all four District of Wonders podcasts.

<p>Ibba Armancas is an emerging filmmaker from Seattle, WA.  She was raised by historical swordfighters, and despite their protests for martial and historical accuracy, the experience forever tied her to the fantasy/science fiction genres. She’s had a script at the Austin Film Festival, and in 2012 won the Jeff Arch Screenwriting Award. She is currently in postproduction for her first feature film, a dark fantasy set in the Pacific Northwest.</p>

<p>Main Fiction: Glister by <a href="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/lumfylomax/newindex.html">Dominic Green</a></p>
<p>Fact: Science News by <a href="http://www.uvulaaudio.com/books.html">J J Campanella</a> 53:30</p>
<p>Promo: Dr Amy H. Sturgis &#8211; <a href="http://www.mythgard.org/news/press/the-gothic-tradition/">“The Gothic Tradition” at Mythgard Institute</a> plus <a href="http://youtu.be/liHNUgw_-rA">YouTube trailer</a></p>
<p>Dominic Green was born in Birmingham, though happily the trauma has erased this from memory, leaving only dim, fleeting flashbacks of shambling, half-human harridans looming over his crib crooning</p>
<p>His parents then moved to one of Britain&#8217;s only nice places, the town of Bakewell. Bakewell is only nice because the government makse it so (i.e., prevents people from building parts of Sheffield and Manchester all over it). It is also a <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/071261530X/202-6787803-9125402">town without pity</a>, but hey, Matlock is a town without pants.</p>
<p>As a child, he thought all the world was like Bakewell. Then they moved to Northampton, where he was disillusioned. Northampton has a tourist office, possibly the most hopeful municipal office anywhere in the world outside Chernobyl.</p>
<p>Green is a product of both the British public school system and Oxbridge, but is surprisingly unhomosexual. He is even married to a nice lady. He has pictures of her if you don&#8217;t believe him. And they don&#8217;t even have staples across the navel.</p>
<p>Green works in IT. Remember those adverts in the newspapers that said &#8216;These are Hard Times Unless You Are In <em><strong>Software</strong></em><strong></strong>?&#8217; They lied to you.</p>
<p>He writes things. He has tried to stop, but is unable to. Some people have to go to the toilet regularly; he has to excrete offensive manuscript at a constant rate. He has to go to the toilet as well, obviously, just like you do. Okay, sometimes he doesn&#8217;t get there quite in time.</p>
<p>He also teaches Gong Fu (Kung Fu to you). You&#8217;d think he&#8217;d be good at it by now.</p>
<p><em></em>Narrator: <a href="http://www.dreaming-monkey.ca/">Stephen Muir</a></p>

                Main Fiction: Glister by &lt;a href=&quot;http://homepage.ntlworld.com/lumfylomax/newindex.html&quot;&gt;Dominic Green&lt;/a&gt;

                Fact: Science News by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uvulaaudio.com/books.html&quot;&gt;J J Campanella&lt;/a&gt; 53:30

                Promo: Dr Amy H. Sturgis - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mythgard.org/news/press/the-gothic-tradition/&quot;&gt;“The Gothic Tradition” at Mythgard Institute&lt;/a&gt; plus &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/liHNUgw_-rA&quot;&gt;YouTube trailer&lt;/a&gt;

                Dominic Green was born in Birmingham, though happily the trauma has erased this from memory, leaving only dim, fleeting flashbacks of shambling, half-human harridans looming over his crib crooning

                His parents then moved to one of Britain&#039;s only nice places, the town of Bakewell. Bakewell is only nice because the government makse it so (i.e., prevents people from building parts of Sheffield and Manchester all over it). It is also a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/071261530X/202-6787803-9125402&quot;&gt;town without pity&lt;/a&gt;, but hey, Matlock is a town without pants.

                As a child, he thought all the world was like Bakewell. Then they moved to Northampton, where he was disillusioned. Northampton has a tourist office, possibly the most hopeful municipal office anywhere in the world outside Chernobyl.

                Green is a product of both the British public school system and Oxbridge, but is surprisingly unhomosexual. He is even married to a nice lady. He has pictures of her if you don&#039;t believe him. And they don&#039;t even have staples across the navel.

                Green works in IT. Remember those adverts in the newspapers that said &#039;These are Hard Times Unless You Are In Software?&#039; They lied to you.

                He writes things. He has tried to stop, but is unable to. Some people have to go to the toilet regularly; he has to excrete offensive manuscript at a constant rate. He has to go to the toilet as well, obviously, just like you do. Okay, sometimes he doesn&#039;t get there quite in time.

                He also teaches Gong Fu (Kung Fu to you). You&#039;d think he&#039;d be good at it by now.

<p>Fact: Synthetic Voices by <a href="http://scienceismagic.com/?p=1591">Jimmy Rogers</a></p>
<p>Interview: <a href="http://waynesimmons.org/">Wayne Simmons</a> 29:00</p>
<p>Novel talked about on interview: <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1907773630?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creativeASIN=1907773630&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=waysimgenficw-21">Plastic Jesus</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.saltpublishing.com/">Salt Publishing </a></p>
<p>Main Fiction: &#8220;Claim Blame&#8221; by <a href="http://www.alandeanfoster.com">Alan Dean Foster</a></p>
<p>Born in New York City in 1946, Foster was raised in Los Angeles. After receiving a Bachelor&#8217;s Degree in Political Science and a Master of Fine Arts in Cinema from UCLA (1968, l969) he spent two years as a copywriter for a small Studio City, Calif. advertising and public relations firm.</p>
<p>His writing career began when August Derleth bought a long Lovecraftian letter of Foster&#8217;s in 1968 and much to Foster&#8217;s surprise, published it as a short story in Derleth&#8217;s bi-annual magazine The Arkham Collector. Sales of short fiction to other magazines followed. His first attempt at a novel, The Tar-Aiym Krang, was bought by Betty Ballantine and published by Ballantine Books in 1972. It incorporates a number of suggestions from famed SF editor John W. Campbell.</p>
<p>Since then, Foster&#8217;s sometimes humorous, occasionally poignant, but always entertaining short fiction has appeared in all the major SF magazines as well as in original anthologies and several &#8220;Best of the Year&#8221; compendiums. His published oeurve includes more than 100 books.</p>
<p>Foster&#8217;s work to date includes excursions into hard science-fiction, fantasy, horror, detective, western, historical, and contemporary fiction. He has also written numerous non-fiction articles on film, science, and scuba diving, as well as having produced the novel versions of many films, including such well-known productions as Star Wars, the first three Alien films, Alien Nation, The Chronicles of Riddick, Star Trek, Terminator:Salvation, and both Transformers films. Other works include scripts for talking records, radio, computer games, and the story for the first Star Trek movie. His novel Shadowkeep was the first ever book adapation of an original computer game. In addition to publication in English his work has been translated into more than fifty languages and has won awards in Spain and Russia. His novel Cyber Way won the Southwest Book Award for Fiction in 1990, the first work of science-fiction ever to do so. He is the recipient of the Faust, the IAMTW Lifetime achievement award.</p>

<p>Main Fiction: &#8220;Today&#8217;s Friends&#8221; by <a href="http://www.snurri.com/">David J. Schwartz</a> 20:00</p>
<p>David J. Schwartz carries Minnesota with him in a small camel-colored attaché with a combination lock; it can only be opened by taking the number of hairs on F. Scott Fitzgerald’s head, dividing it by the secret formula on the Kensington Runestone, and adding the ghostly cry of a loon (usually a negative number). If found, please return to the nearest person wearing flannel.</p>
<p>Because his luggage is full of lakes, he keeps his stories in his head. Sometimes they make it onto paper. They have appeared in numerous publications, including the anthologies <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fantasy-Best-Year-2007/dp/0843959061/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1209226753&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fantasy: Best of the Year 2007</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Best-Lady-Churchills-Rosebud-Wristlet/dp/0345499131/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1209226840&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Best of Lady Churchill’s Rosebud Wristlet</a> and the World Fantasy award-nominated <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Twenty-Epics-Susan-Groppi/dp/1847280668/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1209226890&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Twenty Epics</a>.

His first novel, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Superpowers-Novel-David-J-Schwartz/dp/0307394409" target="_blank">Superpowers</a>, was a Nebula Award nominee.</p>
<p>David has lived in Chicago and Madison, Wisconsin; he now resides in Saint Paul, where he was born and raised. He holds a BA in Scandinavian Studies from the University of Wisconsin at Madison and a Master’s in Library Science from the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana. He would like to set them down somewhere, but not before he figures out a way to use them. He likes oversteeped tea, feeling superior for not owning a car, and streets paved with brick.</p>

<p>Truly&#8230;. are we alone in this universe?</p>
<p>There&#8217;s not one fact or slightest bit of evidence to say yes &#8211; there&#8217;s life out there. I&#8217;m not counting little old ladies living in middle England spotting strange objects in the sky after a sherry or two after their bridge night. And lets not forget Seti. If there was EVER going to be one body that actually could turn up and prove there is life out there &#8211; it would of been Seti. But no&#8230;. not a blip or squeak. Are we really the only ones in this vast playground.</p>
<p>Yes&#8230; if we do the math&#8230; then the laws of average say &#8211; hell, yes&#8230; life is out there.</p>
<p>So, if there is nothing&#8230; are we the seeds? Are we the creatures that expand and expand and populate the worlds. Are we the very first seeds of life in the universe?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had the great privilege a to interview renowned Analog editor Stanley Schmidt for a up coming show for StarShipSofa. One question I asked him really made me think well after the interview was finished. Below is a typed version of that soon to be aired interview.</p>
<p>Me: Has the technology went in a different direction from what you were expecting? In the 60&#8217;s and 70&#8217;s it was all the space race but we seem now to have went into smart phones and wearable computers. Did you expect it to go this direction?</p>
<p>Stan: I think that is a very important point that one of the biggest surprises in the development of technology and a case where science fiction almost completely missed the boat. The whole business of computers and how ubiquitous they have become. Everybody predicted computers but nobody predicted they were going to in every aspect of life for individuals as they do now. You can find a few early evidences of it but we are living in a very science fictional world now, and its a science fictional world that science fiction largely did not anticipate.</p>
<p>I find it fascinating that as Stan says&#8230; on a whole science fiction failed to see where the future was going. I have always thought it was the other way round, that science fiction predicted where we as a whole followed. And sure, like Stan says, there was a few early adopters but for the majority&#8230; we seem to have missed this change in direction. I would like to find out why?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr" align="justify"><a href="http://www.starshipsofa.com/2013/10/02/no-flying-cars/cars_of_the_future_v1/" rel="attachment wp-att-25079"><img title="cars_of_the_future_v1" src="http://www.starshipsofa.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/cars_of_the_future_v1.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="500" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">One thing that said science fiction and the future to me more than anything was the wonder of flying cars. As a small tot I would dream about some distant remote future… maybe even my own where flying cars would zip across the skies like metal birds, darting and dipping between buildings.<span style="line-height: 1.5em; font-size: 0.8em;"> </span></p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">This will never happen now and I am, from a science fiction PoV &#8211; gutted. I wanted so much those Golden Age vehicles to zip and woosh across my skies and the driver/pilot to wave with a cheery smile, but I realise now this/that future will never happen.<span style="line-height: 1.5em; font-size: 0.8em;"> </span></p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">And the reason…<span style="line-height: 1.5em; font-size: 0.8em;"> </span></p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">Power Source: I am no expert but the output needed to lift these little future wonders will be so staggering to the point a totally new power source will be needed. We seem transfixed with electricity and well into the future. Yes, we have all seen those little hydrogen experiments but honestly… is that ever going to happen.<span style="line-height: 1.5em; font-size: 0.8em;"> </span></p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">A Safety/Red Tape/Insurance nightmare. These issues would spoil any flight plan before our future selves could utter the immortal words &#8220;Chocks away&#8221;.<span style="line-height: 1.5em; font-size: 0.8em;"> </span></p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">Life Expectancy: To some degree we have protection if our little ground hugging cars have a bump, but falling out the sky poses slightly more problems to those boffins at Euro ENCAP HQ.<span style="line-height: 1.5em; font-size: 0.8em;"> </span></p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">The cost in time alone (forget the financial) would be staggering but the main reason why we won’t see flying cars ever is not long from now we will be digitised, transferred and uploaded to some World Wide Webtastic Universe… and well, if I can’t have my flying cars – I guess this will be the next best thing!</p>

<p>1. The intellectual excitement of the &#8220;What if?&#8221; scenario.</p>
<p>2. A deeper consideration of what it means to be human.</p>
<p>3. It challenges and stimulates our thoughts and reasoning. Allows<br />
us to ponder different ideas from our own.</p>
<p>4. A place where rationality and creativity come together.</p>
<p>5. Escapism</p>
<p>6. Are we not already living in a very science fiction life &#8211; a little more can&#8217;t hurt.</p>
<p>7. Hope.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>At one time we had £0.63 in the Sofa funds but I felt great!</h2>
<p><em>That&#8217;s true&#8230; not long ago the Sofa funds were down to £0.63</em></p>
<p>StarShipSofa won the Hugo in 2010, part of the District of Wonders Network &#8211; things couldn&#8217;t have been better&#8230; then we hit rock bottom and it could have all gone horribly wrong!</p>
<p>Actually, £0.63 was not the true amount &#8211; we did have £7.63 and then I watched on UK television Comic Relief &#8211; this is a yearly charity fundraiser set up some twenty years ago by UK comedian Lenny Henry. So, I sat and watched and cried like most and decided to give. I was surprised to see just how little was in the account&#8230; £7.63. Not much to give&#8230; and certainly not much to carry on with a broadcasting network&#8230; even one that has won a Hugo:0)</p>
<p>But&#8230; and I&#8217;ve heard this saying many times&#8230;I &#8216;paid it forward&#8217;. I donated £7 to Comic Relief and knew it was the right thing to do. I did the right thing&#8230; it wasn&#8217;t much but two things happened then&#8230; First, I&#8217;d helped in my small way, helped a child or family get a little boost in life. Second, I felt good. I had helped&#8230; I felt better for it&#8230; much better&#8230; <em>I paid it forward</em> and the feelings I got were so much better than if I&#8217;d just hung on the the £7.</p>
<p>So&#8230; can you see where this is going? I&#8217;m asking you&#8230; in a small but important way&#8230;. to <strong>Pay if Forward</strong>. Keep the Sofa going!</p>
<p>We have so much to give and so many glorious years left to discover amazing things&#8230; but we need funding in order to survive.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you have a <strong>science fiction</strong> or <strong>fantasy</strong> or <strong>horror</strong> novel out or due out very soon &#8211;  if you can send me ten mins of narrated audio or the first chapter (whichever comes first) &#8211; we&#8217;ll play it on StarShipSofa! Similar to <a href="http://whatever.scalzi.com/category/big-idea/">Scalzi&#8217;s Big Idea</a> but in audio format.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s my intention to add one of these to each and every StarShipSofa show, which I&#8217;m calling First Chapters. The Sofa is released each and every week. It&#8217;s your chance for a little exposure.</p>
<p>So&#8230; here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m after. It can be any kind of science fiction or fantasy. It has to be an mp3, mono, 128kbps and 10mins long. I also need attached to the beginning of the narration, a couple of mins of you plugging your book &#8211; informing the Sofa listeners what will happen in the book, when the book is out, how much it is and where to buy it.</p>
<p>A word of <strong>warning</strong> about audio quality! Make it the best recording you can. A clean audio file is what we are after. If your mp3 file has excessive amounts of hiss or word stumbles, explosives (words beginning with P or B) paper rustling &#8211; it won&#8217;t get played.</p>
<p>Send all audio files to Tony C. Smith starshipsofa@gmail dot com</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m not going to comment on all of this year&#8217;s Hugo categories, I&#8217;ll leave that for greater minds of this genre industry to mull over. I&#8217;m just concerned with the one that effects StarShipSofa &#8211; the Fancast.</p>
<p>Well, truth is I like it &#8211; I like it a lot.</p>
<p>The Fancast feels like its the right place to put something like StarShipSofa, The Coode Street Podcast, Galactic Suburbia Podcast, SF Signal Podcast, SF Squeecast and all the other great genre podcasts out there. I didn&#8217;t think this at first but now I have had time to reflect. It feels right. We now have a place to call our own in this whirlwind that is the Hugo Awards.</p>
<p>In 2010 when StarShipSofa got herself nominated for a Hugo in the Best Fanzine category the amount of negative vibes and comments about how a podcast was not a fanzine was simply staggering. I was not prepared for it. Thankfully, I had a few shoulders to lean on, especially <a href="http://www.cheryl-morgan.com/">Cheryl Morgan</a>, who in my eyes has done more for the bringing together digital and print factions than any other single person I know. Before any of this new breed of podcaster or blogger (I include StarShipSofa in this group), Cheryl and her <a href="http://www.emcit.com/">Emerald City</a> (1995 &#8211; 2006) blog were there banging the drum for us all to march to. We have a lot to thank Cheryl for &#8211; I especially. Thank you Cheryl.</p>
<p>So, are we agreed? Is the Fancast the best place for podcasts? I think so. Will we be happy? I hope, though I suspect some will still grumble, and saying all that, I will be one of the first to grumble the loudest if the Fancast is not voted back next year.</p>

<p>In 2001 his novella â€œGod Screamed and Screamed, Then I Ate Himâ€ was nominated for a Bram Stoker Award. In 2002, his adaptation and audio production of Gene Wolfeâ€™s â€œThe Tree Is My Hat,â€ was also Stoker nominated. In 2003, his Stoker-recommended â€œCatchingâ€ received Honorable Mention in Ellen Datlowâ€™s 17th Annual â€œYearâ€™s Best Fantasy and Horrorâ€ anthology. In 2004, â€œSo Many Tiny Mouthsâ€ was cited in the anthologyâ€™s 18th edition. In the 20th, his novella, â€œAt Angels Sixteen,â€ from the anthology A DARK AND DEADLY VALLEY, was similarly honored.</p>
<p>Larryâ€™s first novel, â€œJust North of Nowhere,â€ was published in 2007. A collection of his short fiction, DRINK FOR THE THIRST TO COME, was published in 2011.

<h3>Harry Markov</h3>
<p><em>Assistant Editor</em><br />
<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-21954" title="Harry Markov" src="http://talestoterrify.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/photo-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /><br />
Harry Markov is a writer, reviewer and columnist with a predominant interest in the weird, the fantastic and the horrifying. His non-fiction has appeared in Innsmouth Free Press, Beyond Victoriana, The Portal, Pornokitsch and The World SF blog. Most recently he has become an assistant to US publicist Jaym Gates. You can follow Harry on TwitterÂ <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/HarryMarkov">@HarryMarkov</a>Â and find his personal opinions and updates over at Through a Forest of Ideas.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Sarah Hendrix</h3>
<p><em>Assistant Editor</em></p>
<p>Sarah would like to think sheâ€™s awesome, but her kids would wink and tell her: â€œâ€¦no youâ€™re not dude, donâ€™t lie.â€ To spite them, she does a little bit of everything from publicist work for Apex Publications to slush reading for Dagan Books and co-hosting #sffwrtcht on twitter. She staves off insanity by untangling her kitten from yarn and working with tiny beads. Despite her heavy workload, she still finds time to write and edit her own stories and game with her fiance. Her first published story will be in theÂ <em>In SituÂ </em>anthology coming out in December 2011. Look for her other stories in the Space Battles #6 from Flying Pen Press and theÂ <em>FISHÂ </em>anthology from Dagan Books both coming out in 2012. You can find her onÂ <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/shadowflame1974/">Twitter</a>,Â herÂ <a href="http://shadowflame1974.wordpress.com/">blog</a>,<a href="https://www.facebook.com/Shadowflame1974">Facebook</a>,Â andÂ <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/113059498366280581501/posts">Google+</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So I&#8217;m reading Ready Player One by Ernest Cline. If you have not read this then ask as politely as possible &#8211; pick this up! Thing is&#8230; its now got me on a run for this type of story &#8211; I already have waiting in the wings ReadMe by Neal Stephenson&#8230; but what is also out there in that same style? And why is it that this old trope of cyber worlds is still so exciting? I really thought I&#8217;d moved on from the cyberpunk thing &#8211; all the hacking, dropping into electronic worlds &#8211; I thought I had moved away from it but as soon as I started reading Ready Player&#8230; I, like its protagonist &#8211; was in my own virtual world. So, what is it about these type of books that make them so alluring &#8211; or is it just me?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It would be nice to know how many out there retreat into a book in hard times? Most of us have anxieties, highs and lows throughout our lives &#8211; myself more than most :0) Retreating into a story really does take away the lows for me. Is this the case for anyone else? If yes&#8230; what are the stories? I remember a particular bad patch for me (anxiety) and reading Where Late The Sweet Birds Sang by Kate Wilhelm. I&#8217;ve never forgot how much that book helped me through a difficult time in my life.</p>
<p>Many thanks Kate Wilhelm&#8230; you will never know &#8211; but thank you anyways.</p>

<p style="background: white; vertical-align: top;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Mark has had a huge amount of success in the business of Film and TV scripts and heâ€™s going to tell you exactly what to do, in order to get your script in front of leading producers in the industry. Marc has had a successful career as a writer-producer in film and TV, selling over 100 teleplays, screenplays and pilots to every major studio and network, including landmark stories for such shows <em>as STAR TREKâ€“ NEXT GENERATION, DEEP SPACE NINE, FRIDAY THE 13<sup>TH</sup>â€“THE SERIES, TWILIGHT ZONE, BABYLON 5, BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, FOREVER KNIGHT, SLIDERS and (yes) HE-MAN and THE SMURFS.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span></em></span></span></p>

<p style="background: white; vertical-align: top;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: small;">Marc was also nominated for both the Hugo and Nebula awards for &#8220;World Enough and Time,&#8221; a new STAR TREK episode starring George Takei that he co-wrote, directed and executive produced. </span></p>
<p style="background: white; vertical-align: top;">
<p style="background: white; vertical-align: top;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: small;">And he also wrote the story that would eventually become Far Beyond The Stars from Deep Space 9 â€“ a truly amazing story set in 50â€™s America with all issues of race and politics, all mixed with the pulp magazine industry. If you have not seen that particular show I highly recommend it.</span></p>

And hopefully you will have a smile on your face like I did. Granted&#8230; it might not be as big as mine &#8211; but I&#8217;ll let you off.</p>
<p>From Glen&#8217;s email:</p>
<p><em>Tony,</em></p>
<p><em>Greetings from a loyal San Francisco subscriber!</em></p>
<p><em>I work close to the San Francisco Bay waterfront and yesterday I was out at lunch, carrying my copy of the Captainâ€™s Log and listening to the latest Then and Now episode, I had just finished listening to Phillip Jose Farmerâ€™s tale about the aliens and the rocket ships. When I reached the waterfront and looked up I saw this being 40â€™ tall rocket being installed.</em></p>
<p><em>Inspired rocket artâ€¦</em></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
<p><em>Me with the book.</em></p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i289/lightfoot-art/_MG_2879-1.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="700" /></p>
<p><em>While there I got to meet one of the crew Karl Gallick and one of the designers, David Shulma</em>n.</p>

<p><em>Karl with the book.</em></p>
<p><em>And a local news crew showed up and interviewed me and filmed my copy of the Captainâ€™s Log.</em></p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i289/lightfoot-art/_MG_2889.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="700" /></p>

<p><em>Please pass it on to Dee or whoever did the cover art.</em></p>
<p><em>Everyone there, thanks for doing an amazing thing. I listen every week and Iâ€™m enjoying it immensely.</em></p>

<p>The final amount that StartShipSofa and the SF community at large raised in our Spider and Jeanne Robinson Fundraiser&#8230;.. the total amount was Â£3,350 or $5,353. Not bad:0) I&#8217;ve sent over the money and the Robinsons&#8217; are&#8230;.. in Spider&#8217;s words: &#8220;First of all, WOW. I&#8217;m speechless. So is Jeanne, sitting beside me as I type. There are no words&#8230;.except THANKS. Big ones. To you and Neil and John and everyone.&#8221;</p>

<p>Robyn wrote an amazing peice of copy for the Sofa and would you know.. it was picked up by<a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2009/09/18/indie-sf-anthology-w.html"> Boing Boing</a>.Â  Below is what Robyn wrote:</p>
<p><em>Yesterday (September 16, 2009), science fiction podcast magazine <a href="../" target="_blank">StarShipSofaÂ  Aural Delights</a> rang in a new Golden Age of Science Fiction by making publishing history.</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>Celebrating the showâ€™s 100<sup>th</sup> episode, show host and editor Tony C. Smith unveiled <a href="../anthology/" target="_blank">StarShipSofa Stories Volume 1</a>, an anthology of some of the finest stories featured on the show.</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>The book was released simultaneously in print-on-demand paperback (deluxe and standard versions) and a free downloadable ebook. This is absolutely the first anthology to present writers of this calibre without big publisher backing &#8211; from Science Fiction Grand Master Michael Moorcock to Hugo winners Elizabeth Bear and Jeffrey Ford to the SF writer who&#8217;s just bagged the Â£1,000,000 ten book deal Alastair Reynolds (thatâ€™s almost $2,000,000 in the USA), trust me you have never seen an anthology like this one before.</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>Speaking of seeing, thatâ€™s something youâ€™ve <span style="text-decoration: underline;">got</span> to do with this book. Donâ€™t take my word for it â€“ download the <a href="../anthology/ebook/" target="_blank">free ebook</a> or flip through the pages for yourself at this <a href="http://issuu.com/jleuze/docs/starshipsofa-stories-volume-1" target="_blank">super-cool online widget</a>. This volume is an homage to the â€œtatty old paperbacksâ€ of science fiction past, recapturing the visual wonder of the 1950â€™s pulp paperbacks that we all love so well. Original artwork sets off each story, rendered by top artists published by the likes of 2000AD and Neil Gaiman. Sprinkled liberally throughout are original vintage images and magazine adverts from the 1950â€™s. An homage to classic science fiction and a daring experiment in the publishing revolution, this is <em>nostalgia nouveau</em> and <em>tomorrow today</em> all in one package.</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>A great anthology and a bold exploration of the latest in publishing technology, everyone wins with <a href="../anthology/" target="_blank">StarShipSofa Stories Volume 1</a>. Â New and established writers are reaching out to new audiences, sales and donations are being generated to support the show, and a remarkable world-wide community of science fiction fans is growing. Everyone is a winner! There is no doubt that StarShipSofa is leading the way for podcasts into a new and brighter future.</em></p>

<p>StarShipSofa is needing beta testers or to be more precise&#8230; the new StarShipSofa Google Android App called Sofastream is needing beta testers.</p>
<p>Tony sez â€œThis is a brand new way of getting your regular serving of delicious science fiction and we are all very excited about the way the future is shaping up for content providers.</p>
<p>Have you an Android phone? The Sofastream is now ready for a test drive, and I&#8217;d like to ask all those out there with a G1 or similar to grab the beta release from the Android Market place and let us know what you think.â€œ</p>
<p>And if you&#8217;re feeling creative, we&#8217;re running a competition for the best SofaStream icon, too. So get inspired by some of the great StarShipSofa episode art and send your designs to Tony at <a href="mailto:starshipsofa@gmail.com" target="_blank">starshipsofa@gmail.com</a>, who&#8217;ll reward the winner with some tasty fiction.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sondheimguide.com/bishop/bissf-uz.htm#Vinegar">Vinegar Peace, or, The Wrong-Way Used-Adult Orphanage</a> was been published in the July 2008 issue of <em>Asimov&#8217;</em></p>
<p><em><br />
</em></p>
<p><strong>StarShipSofa</strong> narrates Vinegar Peace, a SF story wrote by Michael Bishop for his son Jamie Bishop who died two years ago at the Virginia Tech shooting.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Bishop says:</strong></p>
<p><em>I wrote &#8220;Vinegar Peace&#8221; &#8212; in August of 2007 &#8212; because I had to. Our 35-year-old son, Jamie, died on the morning of April 16, 2007, as one of thirty-two victims of a disturbed shooter on the campus of Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, Virginia.</em></p>
<p><em>Jamie, an accomplished digital artist who did lovely covers for four or five of my books, was holding forth in Room 2007 of Norris Hall in his German class more than two hours after his eventual murderer had slain two students in a dormitory on another part of campus. The administration failed to issue a warning &#8212; a warning that might well have saved many lives &#8212; in a timely fashion. However, some of its members secured their own offices and notified their own family members of this initial event; and so the worst school shooting in the history of the United States claimed our son, four other faculty members (including a man, Dr Librescu, who had survived the Holocaust and who held a table against his classroom door until all own students could escape), four of Jamie&#8217;s students, and twenty-one other young people in Norris Hall, not to mention the first two victims in West Ambler-Johnston dorm. Another twenty-eight students were wounded by bullets or injured leaping from upper-story windows. Some of these young people will live with their injuries the rest of their lives.</em></p>
<p><em>All of the administrators, with the exception of a woman who later died of a stroke or a heart attack (a death that my wife and I can&#8217;t help but attribute partially to the stress of living with the mistakes of the President and the other Policy Group members), remain in their positions. So much for accountability, and so much for justice.</em></p>
<p><em>In any case, &#8220;Vinegar Peace&#8221; grew from this disaster and from a grief that I can&#8217;t imagine ever laying totally aside. Jeri and I mourn Jamie&#8217;s loss every day in some private way, and we think continually of all the other parents and loved ones of the slain and injured who will carry a similar burden with them until they die. We think, too, of the parents and loved ones of the dead and wounded from the United States&#8217;s optional war in Iraq, who long for their dead and who pray for their injured with an intensity not a whit different from our own. How ironic that our son died on American soil. How sad the wasted potential and disfigured lives resulting from violence everywhere. And forgive me the inadequacy of these remarks. Clearly, I wrote a story because I could not address either my outrage or my grief in any other way.</em></p>
<p><em>Mike Bishop</em></p>
<p><strong>StarShipSofa</strong> is very honoured and humbled to be allowed to bring this story to a wider audience. I know I speak for the SF community when I say our hearts and prayers go out to Mike and Jeri and all the families who have to live with this grief every day.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>StarShipSofa delivers science fiction short stories from today best authors.  This audio science fiction magazine podcast has played the very best of today&#8217;s sf, fantasy and horror. Writers from Michael Moorcock, Joe Haldeman to Bruce Sterling and Ted Chiang have all been narrated and played on this podcast.</p>
<p>This week StarShipSofa podcasts all Nebula Short Story nominees for 2008</p>
<p><strong> </strong> <strong><img class="alignnone" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i289/lightfoot-art/SSSNebNom2008500.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="500" /> </strong></p>
<p>StarShipSofa has, in one day, done what no other SF podcast has done before. In another unprecedented move, StarShipSofa has put out all seven Nebula Short Story 2008 nominees, all available as free audio podcasts for your listening pleasure.  Tony, who helms the podcast, says, &#8220;The Nebula&#8217;s are a very special event in the SF world and I wanted the StarShipSofa to mark this occasion by doing something unique for this year&#8217;s awards.  &#8220;I wanted to put out all the stories nominated in one day so people can, straight away, have them downloaded back to back&#8230; sitting on their iPod and,  for the next few hours, submerge themselves in SF stories of the very best calibre. All for free.  &#8220;Things are changing rapidly in this medium and this is one example of StarShipSofa pushing the boundaries of normal podcasting in both terms of quality and accessibility.  &#8220;It&#8217;s what the StarShipSofa was built for.&#8221;</p>
