			<p class="p7"><b>Rcommended Book: </b><i><b>Roboteers </b></i>by
			<i><b>Alex Lamb</b></i></p>
			<p class="p7">Human embryos were &quot;edited&quot; in China this
			year, and the scientific world is up in arms about it. CRISPR and
			Cas9 technologies allow DNA to be manipulated in a fashion
			analogous to the way script-kiddies download and stitch together
			blocks of code to create new applications; for example, creating
			designer micro pets. This was controversial, but prepared no-one
			for the furore which broke out in 2015 over the possible creation
			of viable human embryos in Chinese laboratories. Disputes over the
			nature of &quot;purity&quot; of human beings will be more
			multi-faceted than the simpler pro-life/pro-choice debates of the
			last fifty years, but probably just as heated. How will different
			societies respond?</p>
			<p class="p7">Alex Lamb showed uncanny timing when he released his
			Hard SF novel <i>Roboteer </i>under the tagline, &quot;One
			species. One Universe. Two Sides.&quot; He projects the dilemmas
			that genetech will create into our futures. The background to the
			book is a familiar conflict: Mother Earth wants her errant
			children to come back to her arms. Momma knows best and the kids
			have been so terribly naughty. Lamb's future Earth is ruled by a
			tyrannical zealot who employs science, religion and warfare to
			bring former colonies to heel. Unlike the Earthers, the colonials
			adapt to their environs with genetic and cybernetic mods to make
			them faster, stronger, tougher and networked. They are heavily
			outnumbered, and the real story begins when they find a sublimed
			gardener civilisation and its deadly weapons. 
			</p>
			<p class="p7">Colonial Roboteer, Will Kuno-Monet and his people
			will be OK because the sublimed want to prune only those
			civilisations who do not wish to improve and grow. Does Will owe
			his oppressors any protection from the judgement of the sublimed?</p>
			<p class="p7">Lamb's writing is solid, and the range of character
			types allows his novel to comfortably fall into the category of
			Space Opera. Although the book is Hard SF, the science leans
			towards &quot;conveniently magical.&quot; An interesting feature
			of the story is the descriptions of ships as complex leviathans
			with only tiny pockets of crew space. Military buffs with an eye
			to the Cold War will recognise weapons platforms where the crew
			were annoying biological afterthoughts. Similarly, the book takes
			us to conceivable scenarios for the effects of automation on
			economies and societies. Ultimately, the book can be recommended
			for the typical Sofanaut as it's chock-full of compelling baddies,
			light years of space chases and buckets of derring-do. In
			particular, 'Roboteers' would find a home in the Chrimbo stocking
			of any Space Opera or Military SF fan.&nbsp;</p>

			<p class="p7"><b>From Tales to Terrify:</b> <i><b>The Most
			Horrible X-mas Ever&quot; - Invader Zim</b></i>&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="p7">by Scott Silk&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="p7"><br><br>
			</p>
			<p class="p7">This holiday season, while many are snuggling up to
			watch Charlie Brown attempt to decorate an impotent evergreen, I
			will be enjoying my own favorite animated X-mas special which
			portrays a slightly darker vision of holiday cheer. I’m
			referring, of course, to “The Most Horrible X-mas Ever”
			episode of the Invader Zim television series.&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="p7">In 2001, when Invader Zim first aired, I was already
			a fan of his more adult-oriented comic books like “Johnny the
			Homicidal Maniac” and “Squee!,” and I remember being
			somewhat awed that Vasquez had managed to maintain a style mostly
			unsuitable for children when putting together the series for the
			Nickelodeon network. The series is centered around alien invader
			Zim and his failed attempts to conquer Earth. To this end, he
			disguises his malfunctioning robot sidekick as a green dog and
			himself as a green-skinned, human schoolchild. He is recognized
			and often thwarted by his paranormal-minded schoolmate, Dib.&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="p7">If you’ve never been exposed to the work of Jhonen
			Vasquez, it’s best described as dark comedic horror. The
			settings are frequently nightmare worlds which are parodies of our
			own, and the people who populate Vasquez’s worlds, especially
			the children, are frequently portrayed as revolting creatures. In
			Invader Zim, for example, the fast food “shakes” at MacMeaties
			are made entirely of nauseatingly processed meats, an obvious jab
			at McDonald’s french fries containing inexplicable cow
			flavorings, but the populous appears to love nothing more.&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="p7">The scene of the X-mas special opens on Mr. Sludgy,
			the robotic snowman, 2 million years in the future. He’s telling
			a group of small, hideous children gathered around a fire the
			story of The Most Horrible X-mas Ever. That holiday season, Zim
			hatched a plan to impersonate Santa Claus in order to convince the
			entire population of Earth to build a space teleporter capable of
			sending all humans to their doom. One human asks, “Will being
			teleported to our doom be fun and X-masy?” Of course it will.&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="p7">SPOILER ALERT As usual, Zim’s technology turns on
			him, and the Santa suit he created as a disguise gains a mind of
			it’s own and transforms into a horrifying X-mas monster.
			Thankfully, Dib, with the help of his sister and father, is able
			to subdue the suit and save X-mas by shooting Santa into space.
			Back in the future with Mr. Sludgy, Santa apparently lives on. Not
			in the hearts and minds of the children, but in space, where he
			rests and gains power in order to return to Earth for another
			X-mas attack.</p>

			<p class="p8" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">I received another
			message by chronorobopigeon from 2005, back when I started
			StarShipSofa. See if you can make any sense of it, 'cause I'm
			b*ggered if I can!:</p>
			<p class="p7"><br><i>Dear Tony,<br>I can't believe I've finally
			seen the last ever Star Wars movie - and it's left me with so many
			more questions than I had when I saw the first one. Why does
			ObiWan Kenobi wear Jedi Uniform on Tatooine when he's trying to
			hide and look after young Luke? Why doesn't anyone recognise C3PO
			and R2D2? What is the point of the Jedi Academy if you can learn
			to be a Jedi in a week in a swamp? Why would Vader (or Palpatine?)
			let there be 3 Sith if they managed to turn Luke to the Dark Side?
			Someone would get killed! What happened to R2D2's rockets? How did
			C3PO get built in the first place? How can Leia remember her &quot;Kind
			but Sad&quot; mum? Did George Lucas actually watch Eps 4 5 and 6
			before making 1 2 and 3??? Well Tony, when you read this in ten
			years time, hopefully Star Wars will have faded from public
			consciousness along with the bad taste in my mouth. I hope they're
			still making Science Fiction movies in the future. What's the
			blockbuster this year? I hope it's not some godawful rubbish from
			Disney.</i>&nbsp;</p>
