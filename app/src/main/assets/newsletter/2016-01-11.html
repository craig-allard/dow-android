            <p class="p7">Hello

</p>
<p class="p7">Ok,
    so I’m going to get this off my chest. I’m going to spill the
    beans on my childhood. Give you a little glimpse into how I grew up
    and what I got up to.</p>
<p class="p7">The
    first thing you need to know… books and me don’t go that far
    back. I was twenty before I read my first book!</p>
<p class="p7">When
    I interview writers it’s nearly always the case that they were
    reading before they could tie their shoelaces. Well, not for me.
    School and books and reading were so far away from what I wanted to
    do as a child. All I wanted to do was skip and whoop with delight -
    as we called it - ‘playing out'.</p>
<p class="p7">I
    love Dylan Thomas poem Fern Hill and the first line Now as I was
    young and easy under the apple boughs. That was my life to some
    extent - playing out, swimming in lakes, climbing, running.</p>
<p class="p7">Now
    I’m painting this as a little too idyllic… reality was we were
    ‘naughty’. Best way to describe me and my friends would be
    ‘little rips’. Another would be ‘bloody nuisances’. Yeah…
    maybe that is a better description. We were forever getting into
    trouble.</p>
<p class="p7">It
    was what you did as a child - it was a given that you were going to
    be trouble. Not trouble like fighting or stealing, but enough to have
    people chase us all over the place.</p>
<p class="p7">And
    fires! Oh fires were the magic that drew us all out into the open. We
    set so many things alight when we were young. You name it… corn
    fields, sheds, straw bails, other kids camps - all were targets for
    us. Fires really were the essential playthings of my childhood.</p>
<p class="p7">Throughout
    the year, all our fire lighting was training for the ‘big day’.
    The one day where lighting fires in the UK was ok. I’m talking
    about Guy Fawkes night on the 5th of November. This was our day!</p>
<p class="p7">It
    was a given that you build your bonfire the biggest you possibly
    could the week leading up to Guy Fawkes night, and it was also given
    that you would try to burn down everyone else's bonfires before the
    glorious 5th! We would always have two kids guarding our fire against
    rogue ‘starters’, and the rest of us would be away hunting
    through the estates for other fires to burn.</p>
<p class="p7">The
    sheer excitement I felt then scrabbling over garden fences is coming
    back to me now. Yes… it was wrong but it was also... so
    exhilarating. All fires were game. It mattered not if it was a big
    gang fire like our own, a public display fire, or even a little fire
    in someone's garden. If our pile was standing up and ready, we would,
    armed with our bottles and cans of petrol, go marauding for fires to
    start. If we hit lucky and set a hold of another villages fire or
    gang fire, we had to be especially vigilant of our own in case of
    reprisals.</p>
<p class="p7">I
    will always remember one fire we lit. Looking back it was silly me
    and, trust me, very dangerous - but the thrill then outweighed the
    risks. It was a week before Guy Fawkes Night, and we had traveled
    far, much further than usual. We’d taken our bikes, and if memory
    serves we had gone about seven or eight miles to our target. We had
    discussed at school that we would hit this particular fire. It was
    big. The gang was big. The town it was in was big!</p>
<p class="p7">Now,
    when I say gangs here it is nothing like what we now think of as gang
    culture. This was just groups of kids growing up in the countryside.
    I think we were (and my memory of this is sketchy)... I believe there
    must have been ten of us that night. It was around 7pm - an ideal
    time for the thrills to begin.</p>
<p class="p7">Now…
    this is no word of a lie: our little ‘thing’ was to totally
    demolish an opponents fire. Our mission was not a success if the pile
    was still even partially standing - if it wasn't completely
    destroyed, we had failed.</p>
<p class="p7">One
    of the ways we would make sure the fire was destroyed - really
    destroyed - was to blow it up as well as burn it to the ground.
    Blowing it up involved lighting it up with petrol, but also putting
    in a small gas camping bottle. When the fire took hold, the gas
    bottle would explode and blow the fire out!</p>
<p class="p7">I
    remember this fire we’d picked for that night's target was huge. We
    didn’t know any of the kids who'd built it… we were, as I
    mentioned, quite a long way from home. And this was a big fire..
    really big. So we needed a *big* gas bottle!</p>
<p class="p7">I
    know… I know... As I type this now at the age of forty-nine I’m
    slightly staggered at the level of danger we put ourselves in, and
    others. Honestly... now that I'm writing it down I’m having a hard
    time putting this in here!</p>
<p class="p7">Anyways…
    we had to get over a large area of waste ground to get at their pile.
    Luckily no one was guarding the fire, and it was a clean sprint to
    the target.</p>
<p class="p7">I
    remember to this day the size of the gas bottle - it was so big it
    was made out of iron and not aluminium! The flames shot into the air
    as we all throw our bottles of petrol on. I’m not sure why but
    anyways setting it a light was easy, and no one from their gang came.</p>
<p class="p7">We
    scrabbled back to a safe distance to watch her ‘go up’. And up
    she went! When it did blow, it was literally like a small atomic bomb
    going off. I can still see the mushroom cloud going up with the
    explosion... It was a big fire when we got there… and then that big
    gas bottle... The explosion was so huge it put out a couple of house
    windows in the area! The fire was completely destroyed, and all the
    night sky was awash with tiny fire embers. They flickered to earth
    like tiny shooting stars.</p>
<p class="p7">It
    really was one of those eerie moments deafened by silence. I think we
    were all stunned by what had happened. It really was a spectacular
    sight...</p>
<p class="p7">But,
    we all knew this was one explosion too much for us. At that age, we
    had never for one minute contemplated the risks. I’m really not
    sure if we’d have listened if someone had tried to tell us before
    that our little game was dangerous, and that one of us could have
    easily been killed by flying shrapnel that night. But, once that fire
    went ‘up’, something changed in all of us.</p>
<p class="p7">We
    heard later that it had blow a three foot deep hole in the ground!
    The sight of all those amber specs of fire filling and floating in
    the sky has stayed with me all these years. I can even recall the
    concussion of it hitting my chest as the explosion ripped through the
    fire.</p>
<p class="p7">It
    was the last stunt for us, but the memories have never left. We never
    did go back and start any more fires. It was the last time our little
    gang would peddle into the night looking for rival piles to burn.
    Yes… we still had our own fire each year, but even that was
    somewhat staid by what we had done that night.</p>
<p class="p7">It
    really was such a silly stupid thing to do and now, if I was to find
    out my son was doing the same thing… Well… I would bring a whole
    load of trouble down on him. Funny though… I feel when I was a kid
    - we really knew how to live our little lives to the full. Now it’s
    very rare my youngest son goes out. The lure of Xbox has a bigger
    pull on them these days.</p>
<p class="p7">Still…
    I have the memories. Yes it was a silly thing to do, really silly
    but… how easy and carefree our lives were back then.</p>
<p class="p7">Now
    as I was young and easy under the apple boughs.</p>
<p class="p7">Would
    I do it all over again?</p>
<p class="p7">You
    bet!</p>
<p class="p7">There
    you go. A little trip down the misbegotten adventures of my youth.
    It’s great being able to share it with you here in the District of
    Wonders. I still get excited when there's a fire these days - it’s
    still there within me, the thrill and excitement of those carefree
    days. They were good times, if not terribly wise, and I can still get
    the thrill of the fire and no one worries unless I burn the burgers
    on the barbie!</p>
<p class="p7">Take
    care,</p>
<p class="p7">Tony</p>
